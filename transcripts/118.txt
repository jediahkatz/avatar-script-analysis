Sokka:: I'm not one to complain, but can't Appa fly any higher?
Aang:: I have an idea, why don't we all get on your back and you can fly us to the North Pole?
Sokka:: I'd love to! Climb on everyone , Sokka's ready for takeoff!
Katara:: Look, we're all just a little tired and cranky because we've been flying for two days straight.
Sokka:: And for what? We can't even find the Northern Water Tribe. There's nothing up here.
Katara:: They're waterbenders! We found the Water Tribe!
Zhao:: He's heading north. The Northern Water Tribe. The Avatar needs to master waterbending. He's looking for a teacher.
Captain Li:: Then what are we waiting for? Let's go get him!
Zhao:: Patience, Captain Li. This isn't some little Earth village we can just march into. The Water Tribe is a great nation. There's a reason they've survived a hundred years of war. The frozen tundra is treacherous. The landscape itself is an icy fortress. We'll need a massive invasion force.
Aang:: There it is!
Katara:: The Northern Water Tribe...
Sokka:: We're finally here...
Katara:: I can't believe how many waterbenders live up here!
Aang:: We'll find a master to teach us, no problem!
Katara :: This place is beautiful.
Sokka:: Yeh, she is.
Iroh:: Winter, spring, summer and fall. Wi/bnter and spring, summer and fall. Four seasons, four loves. Four seasons, four loves.
Chief Arnook:: Tonight, we celebrate the arrival of our brother and sister from the Southern Tribe, and they have brought with them someone very special, someone whom many of us believed disappeared from the world until now.  The Avatar! We also celebrate my daughter's 16th birthday. Princess Yue is now of marrying age.
Princess Yue:: Thank you, father. May the great Ocean and Moon Spirits watch over us during these troubled times.
Chief Arnook:: Now, Master Pakku and his students will perform!
Sokka:: Hi, there. Sokka, Southern Water Tribe.
Princess Yue:: Very nice to meet you.
Sokka:: So... uh... you're a Princess!  You know, back in my tribe, I'm kinda like a Prince myself!
Katara:: Ha! Prince of what?
Sokka :: A lot of things! Uh, do you mind? I'm trying to have a conversation here!
Katara :: My apologies, Prince Sokka.
Sokka :: So it looks like I'm gonna be in town for awhile. I'm thinking maybe we could... do an activity together?
Princess Yue:: Do an “activity”?
Katara:: Very smooth.
Chief Arnook:: Master Pakku, meet your newest student, the Avatar.
Master Pakku:: Just because you're destined to save the world, don't expect any special treatment.
Aang :: My friend and I can't wait to start training with you – after we relax for a couple days.
Master Pakku:: If you want to relax, then I suggest visiting a tropical island. If not, I'll see you both at sunrise. Good night.
Zuko:: For the last time, I'm not playing the sumki horn.
Iroh:: No, it's about our plans. There's a bit of a problem.
Zhao:: I'm taking your crew.
Zuko :: What!?
Zhao:: I've recruited them for a little expedition to the North Pole.
Zhao:: Uncle, is that true?
Iroh:: I'm afraid so. He's taking everyone. Even the cook!
Zhao:: Sorry you won't be there to watch me capture the Avatar. But I can't have you getting in my way again.
Zhao:: I didn't know you were skilled with broadswords, Prince Zuko.
Zuko:: I'm not. They're antiques. Just decorative.
Zhao:: Have you heard of the Blue Spirit, General Iroh?
Iroh:: Just rumors. I don't think he is real.
Zhao:: He's real all right. He's a criminal, an enemy of the Fire Nation.  But I have a feeling that justice will catch up with him soon.  General Iroh, the offer to join my mission still stands if you change your mind.
Katara:: I've waited for this day my whole life! I finally get to learn from a real waterbending master!
Aang:: Good morning, Master Pakku!
Master Pakku:: No, please, march right in, I'm not concentrating or anything.
Aang:: Uhh... this is my friend, Katara, the one I told you about?
Master Pakku:: I'm sorry. I think there's been a misunderstanding. You didn't tell me your friend was a girl. In our tribe, it is forbidden for women to learn waterbending.
Katara:: What do you mean you won't teach me?  I didn't travel across the entire world so you could tell me “no”!
Master Pakku:: No.
Katara:: But there must be other female waterbenders in your tribe!
Master Pakku:: Here the women learn from Yugoda to use their waterbending to heal. I'm sure she would be happy to take you as her student despite your bad attitude.
Katara:: I don't want to heal, I want to fight!
Master Pakku:: I can see that. But our tribe has customs, rules.
Katara:: Well your rules stink!
Aang:: Yeh! They're not fair. If you won't teach Katara, then –
Master Pakku:: Then what?
Aang:: Then I won't learn from you!
Master Pakku:: Well have fun teaching yourself. I'm sure you'll do a great job.
Katara:: Wait!  Aang didn't mean that.
Katara:: You can't risk your training for me. You have to learn from Master Pakku. Even if he is a big jerk.
Master Pakku:: Why don't we get started then.
Sokka:: Princess Yue! Good morning! Hey, how about that picnic last night? Boy, your Dad sure knows how to throw a party.
Princess Yue:: I'm happy you enjoyed yourself.
Sokka:: Well, it wasn't as much fun after you left.
Sokka:: So, I'm still hoping we can see more of each other.
Princess Yue:: Do an “activity”, you mean?
Sokka:: Yes! At... a place! For... some time!
Princess Yue:: I'd love to! I'll meet you on that bridge tonight.
Sokka:: Great! I'll see you – aahh!
Princess Yue:: Sorry!
Sokka :: That's okay, it was worth it.  See you tonight.
Zhao:: I'm very impressed.
Zhao:: You all seem highly qualified for the mission I have in mind.
Pirate Barker:: That's some tasty gold!
Pirate Captain:: What do you need us to do?
Zhao :: I believe you're acquainted with Prince Zuko?
Katara:: Um, hi. Are you Yagoda?
Yugoda:: Are you here for the healing lesson?
Katara :: I guess I am.
Yugoda:: Welcome! Welcome!
Master Pakku:: You're moving the water around, but you're not feeling the push and pull.
Aang:: I'm trying!
Master Pakku:: Maybe that move is too advanced for you. Why don't you try an easier one?
Katara:: Thanks for the lesson.
Yugoda:: So, who's the lucky boy?
Katara:: Huh?
Yugoda:: Your betrothal necklace. You're getting married, right?
Katara:: No, I don't think I'm ready for that yet. My grandmother gave my mother this necklace, and my mother passed it down to me.
Yugoda:: I recognize this carving! I don't know why I didn't realize sooner! You're the spitting image of Kana!
Katara :: Wait, how do you know my Gran-Gran's name?
Yugoda:: When I was about your age I was friends with Kana. She was born here, in the Northern Tribe.
Katara :: She never told me.
Yugoda:: Your grandmother had an arranged marriage with a young waterbender. He carved that necklace for her.
Katara:: If Gran-Gran was engaged, why did she leave?
Yugoda:: I don't know. That's always been a mystery to me. She left without saying goodbye.
Iroh:: The crew wanted me to wish you safe travels.
Zuko:: Good riddance to those traitors.
Iroh:: It's a lovely night for a walk. Why don't you join me? It would clear your head. Or, just stay in your room and sit in the dark. Whatever makes you happy.
Pirate Barker:: Careful with the blasting jelly!
Zuko :: Uncle?  Uncle, is that you?
Iroh:: Zuko!
Iroh :: Zuko...
Sokka:: Hi, Princess Yue.  I made you something. I carved it myself.
Princess Yue:: It's a bear.
Sokka:: Actually, it's a fish , see it has a fin.
Princess Yue:: Oh. I'm sorry! I made a mistake.  I shouldn't have asked you to come here!
Katara:: How's warrior training going?
Aang:: That bad?
Sokka:: No, it's Princess Yue. I don't get it. One minute she wants to go out with me and the next she's telling me to get lost! So how's waterbending training?
Aang:: Master Poophead won't teach her because she's a girl.
Sokka:: Why don't you just teach her, Aang?
Katara :: Why didn't I think of that? At night, you can teach whatever moves you learned from Master Pakku. That way you have someone to practice with and I get to learn waterbending. Everyone's happy!
Sokka:: I'm not happy.
Katara:: But you're never happy. Come on, Aang.
Aang:: Master Pakku said this move is all about sinking and floating.
Katara:: I got it!
Aang:: That was amazing!
Katara:: That wasn't me.
Aang:: I... I was just showing Katara a few moves.
Master Pakku:: You have disrespected me, my teachings, and my entire culture.
Aang:: I'm sorry, I –
Master Pakku:: You are no longer welcome as my student.
Chief Arnook:: What do you want me to do? Force Master Pakku to take Aang back as his student?
Katara:: Yes – please!
Chief Arnook:: I suspect he might change his mind if you swallow your pride and apologize to him.
Katara:: Fine.
Master Pakku:: I'm waiting, little girl.
Katara:: No! No way am I apologizing to a sour old man like you!
Aang:: Uh, Katara...
Aang:: I'm sure she didn't mean that.
Sokka:: Yeh, I think she did.
Zhao:: I'm devastated to hear about Prince Zuko.  Just devastated.
Iroh:: The Fire Lord will not be pleased he learns who was responsible.
Zhao:: You know who... was behind the attack?
Iroh:: Yes...  pirates! We had a run in with them awhile back.
Iroh:: They wanted revenge.
Zhao :: So, have you reconsidered my offer?
Iroh :: Yes, I accept. It will be an honor to serve as your general.  To the Fire Nation!
Zhao:: To victory!
Sokka:: Are you crazy, Katara? You're not gonna win this fight!
Katara :: I know! I don't care!
Aang:: You don't have to do this for me. I can find another teacher.
Katara:: I'm not doing it for you! Someone needs to slap some sense into that guy!
Katara:: So, you decided to show up?  Aren't you gonna fight?
Master Pakku:: Go back to the healing huts with the other women where you belong.
Master Pakku:: Fine. You want to learn to fight so bad, study closely!
Master Pakku:: Don't worry, I'm not going to hurt you!
Katara:: You can't knock me down!
Aang:: Go Katara!
Master Pakku:: Well, I'm impressed. You are an excellent waterbender.
Katara:: But you still won't teach me, will you?
Master Pakku:: No.
Master Pakku:: This fight is over.
Katara:: Come back here! I'm not finished yet!
Master Pakku:: Yes, you are.
Master Pakku:: This is my necklace!
Katara:: No it's not, it's mine! Give it back!
Master Pakku:: I made this sixty years ago – for the love of my life. For Kana.
Katara:: My Gran-Gran was supposed to marry you?
Iroh:: Our plan is working perfectly. Zhao doesn't suspect a thing.
Zuko:: You didn't have to do this.
Iroh:: No nephew of mine is going to stow away on a ship without some backup!
Zuko:: Thank you, Uncle.
Iroh :: Someone's coming!  Stay hidden until we get to the North Pole and the Avatar will be yours! Good luck!
Master Pakku :: I carved this necklace for your grandmother when we got engaged. I thought we would have a long, happy life together. I loved her.
Katara:: But she didn't love you, did she? It was an arranged marriage.
Katara:: Gran-Gran wouldn't let your tribe's stupid customs run her life. That's why she left. It must have taken a lot of courage.
Aang:: Go get her.
Princess Yue:: What do you want from me?
Sokka:: Nothing. I just want you to know, I think you're beautiful... and, I never thought a girl like you would even notice a guy like me.
Princess Yue:: You don't understand.
Sokka:: No, no, see, that's the thing. I think I do understand now. You're a princess, and I... I'm just a southern peasant.
Princess Yue:: No, Sokka...
Sokka:: It's okay. You don't have to say anything.  I'll see ya around, okay?
Sokka:: Okay, now I'm really confused! Happy – but confused!
Princess Yue:: I do like you! A lot. But, we can't be together – and not for the reason you think. It's because...  ...I'm engaged. I'm sorry!
Master Pakku:: Not bad! Not bad! Heheh! Keep practicing and maybe you'll get it by the time you're my age!
Aang:: Hey Katara!
Master Pakku:: What do you think you're doing? It's past sunrise.  You're late.
Aang:: Good to see ya here.
Katara:: You too.
Zhao:: My fleet is ready. Set a course for the Northern Water Tribe.
