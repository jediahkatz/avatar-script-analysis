Aang:: I have an idea, why don't we all get on your back and you can fly us to the North Pole?
Sokka:: I'd love to! Climb on everyone , Sokka's ready for takeoff!
Katara:: Look, we're all just a little tired and cranky because we've been flying for two days straight.
Sokka:: And for what? We can't even find the Northern Water Tribe. There's nothing up here.
Katara:: They're waterbenders! We found the Water Tribe!
Zhao:: He's heading north. The Northern Water Tribe. The Avatar needs to master waterbending. He's looking for a teacher.
Captain Li:: Then what are we waiting for? Let's go get him!
Zhao:: Patience, Captain Li. This isn't some little Earth village we can just march into. The Water Tribe is a great nation. There's a reason they've survived a hundred years of war. The frozen tundra is treacherous. The landscape itself is an icy fortress. We'll need a massive invasion force.
Aang:: There it is!
Sokka:: We're finally here...
Katara:: I can't believe how many waterbenders live up here!
Aang:: We'll find a master to teach us, no problem!
Princess Yue:: Thank you, father. May the great Ocean and Moon Spirits watch over us during these troubled times.
Chief Arnook:: Now, Master Pakku and his students will perform!
Katara:: Ha! Prince of what?
Princess Yue:: Do an “activity”?
Katara:: Very smooth.
Chief Arnook:: Master Pakku, meet your newest student, the Avatar.
Master Pakku:: Just because you're destined to save the world, don't expect any special treatment.
Master Pakku:: If you want to relax, then I suggest visiting a tropical island. If not, I'll see you both at sunrise. Good night.
Zuko:: For the last time, I'm not playing the sumki horn.
Iroh:: No, it's about our plans. There's a bit of a problem.
Zhao:: I'm taking your crew.
Zhao:: I've recruited them for a little expedition to the North Pole.
Zhao:: Uncle, is that true?
Iroh:: I'm afraid so. He's taking everyone.  Even the cook!
Zhao:: Sorry you won't be there to watch me capture the Avatar. But I can't have you getting in my way again.
Zhao:: I didn't know you were skilled with broadswords, Prince Zuko.
Zuko:: I'm not. They're antiques. Just decorative.
Zhao:: Have you heard of the Blue Spirit, General Iroh?
Iroh:: Just rumors. I don't think he is real.
Zhao:: He's real all right. He's a criminal, an enemy of the Fire Nation.  But I have a feeling that justice will catch up with him soon.  General Iroh, the offer to join my mission still stands if you change your mind.
Katara:: I've waited for this day my whole life! I finally get to learn from a real waterbending master!
Aang:: Good morning, Master Pakku!
Aang:: Uhh... this is my friend, Katara, the one I told you about?
Katara:: What do you mean you won't teach me?  I didn't travel across the entire world so you could tell me “no”!
Master Pakku:: No.
Master Pakku:: Here the women learn from Yugoda to use their waterbending to heal. I'm sure she would be happy to take you as her student despite your bad attitude.
Katara:: I don't want to heal, I want to fight!
Master Pakku:: I can see that. But our tribe has customs, rules.
Katara:: Well your rules stink!
Aang:: Yeh! They're not fair. If you won't teach Katara, then –
Aang:: Then I won't learn from you!
Master Pakku:: Well have fun teaching yourself. I'm sure you'll do a great job.
Katara:: Wait!  Aang didn't mean that.
Katara:: You can't risk your training for me. You have to learn from Master Pakku. Even if he is a big jerk.
Master Pakku:: Why don't we get started then.
Sokka:: Princess Yue! Good morning!  Hey, how about that picnic last night? Boy, your Dad sure knows how to throw a party.
Princess Yue:: I'm happy you enjoyed yourself.
Sokka:: Well, it wasn't as much fun after you left.
Sokka:: So, I'm still hoping we can see more of each other.
Princess Yue:: Do an “activity”, you mean?
Princess Yue:: I'd love to!  I'll meet you on that bridge tonight.
Sokka:: Great! I'll see you – aahh!
Princess Yue:: Sorry!
Zhao:: I'm very impressed.
Zhao:: You all seem highly qualified for the mission I have in mind. , who has opened the chest to reveal glowing riches inside. The Pirate Salesmen removes a gold piece and bites it.)
Pirate Barker:: That's some tasty gold!
Pirate Captain:: What do you need us to do?
Katara:: Um, hi. Are you Yagoda?
Yugoda:: Are you here for the healing lesson?
Yugoda:: Welcome! Welcome!
Master Pakku:: You're moving the water around, but you're not feeling the push and pull.
Katara:: Thanks for the lesson.
Yugoda:: So, who's the lucky boy?
Katara:: Huh?
Yugoda:: When I was about your age I was friends with Kana. She was born here, in the Northern Tribe.
Yugoda:: Your grandmother had an arranged marriage with a young waterbender. He carved that necklace for her.
Katara:: If Gran-Gran was engaged, why did she leave?
Yugoda:: I don't know. That's always been a mystery to me. She left without saying goodbye.
Iroh:: The crew wanted me to wish you safe travels.
Zuko:: Good riddance to those traitors.
Iroh:: It's a lovely night for a walk. Why don't you join me? It would clear your head.  Or, just stay in your room and sit in the dark. Whatever makes you happy.
Iroh:: Zuko!
Sokka:: Hi, Princess Yue.  I made you something. I carved it myself.
Princess Yue:: It's a bear.
Sokka:: Actually, it's a fish , see it has a fin.
Princess Yue:: Oh.  I'm sorry! I made a mistake.  I shouldn't have asked you to come here!
Katara:: How's warrior training going?
Aang:: That bad?
Sokka:: No, it's Princess Yue. I don't get it. One minute she wants to go out with me and the next she's telling me to get lost!  So how's waterbending training?
Aang:: Master Poophead won't teach her because she's a girl.
Sokka:: Why don't you just teach her, Aang?
Sokka:: I'm not happy.
Katara:: But you're never happy. Come on, Aang.
Aang:: Master Pakku said this move is all about sinking and floating.
Katara:: I got it!
Aang:: That was amazing!
Katara:: That wasn't me.
Aang:: I... I was just showing Katara a few moves.
Master Pakku:: You have disrespected me, my teachings, and my entire culture.
Aang:: I'm sorry, I –
Master Pakku:: You are no longer welcome as my student.
Chief Arnook:: What do you want me to do? Force Master Pakku to take Aang back as his student?
Katara:: Yes – please!
Chief Arnook:: I suspect he might change his mind if you swallow your pride and apologize to him.
Katara:: Fine.
Master Pakku:: I'm waiting, little girl.
Katara:: No! No way am I apologizing to a sour old man like you!
Aang:: Uh, Katara...
Aang:: I'm sure she didn't mean that.
Sokka:: Yeh, I think she did.
Zhao:: I'm devastated to hear about Prince Zuko.  Just devastated.
Iroh:: Yes...  pirates! We had a run in with them awhile back.
Iroh:: They wanted revenge.
Sokka:: Are you crazy, Katara? You're not gonna win this fight!
Aang:: You don't have to do this for me. I can find another teacher.
Katara:: I'm not doing it for you! Someone needs to slap some sense into that guy!
Katara:: So, you decided to show up?  Aren't you gonna fight?
Katara:: You can't knock me down!
Aang:: Go Katara!
Master Pakku:: Well, I'm impressed. You are an excellent waterbender.
Katara:: But you still won't teach me, will you?
Master Pakku:: No.
Katara:: Come back here! I'm not finished yet!
Master Pakku:: Yes, you are.
Katara:: No it's not, it's mine! Give it back!
Master Pakku:: I made this sixty years ago – for the love of my life.  For Kana.
Katara:: My Gran-Gran was supposed to marry you?
Iroh:: Our plan is working perfectly. Zhao doesn't suspect a thing.
Iroh:: No nephew of mine is going to stow away on a ship without some backup!
Zuko:: Thank you, Uncle.
Katara:: But she didn't love you, did she? It was an arranged marriage.
Aang:: Go get her.
Princess Yue:: What do you want from me?
Sokka:: Nothing. I just want you to know, I think you're beautiful... and, I never thought a girl like you would even notice a guy like me.
Princess Yue:: You don't understand.
Sokka:: No, no, see, that's the thing. I think I do understand now. You're a princess, and I... I'm just a southern peasant.
Princess Yue:: No, Sokka...
Sokka:: It's okay. You don't have to say anything.  I'll see ya around, okay?
Sokka:: Okay, now I'm really confused! Happy – but confused!
Princess Yue:: I do like you! A lot. But, we can't be together – and not for the reason you think. It's because...  ...I'm engaged. I'm sorry!
Master Pakku:: Not bad! Not bad! Heheh! Keep practicing and maybe you'll get it by the time you're my age!
Aang:: Hey Katara!
Aang:: Good to see ya here.
Zhao:: My fleet is ready. Set a course for the Northern Water Tribe.
