Sokka:: You guys are gonna be done soon, right?
Sokka:: We've got a lot of ground to cover if we wanna make it to Omashu today.
Katara:: What, like you're ready to go right now, naked guy?
Sokka:: I can be ready in two minutes. Seriously. Whenever.
Aang:: So, you were showing me the octopus form.
Katara:: Right. Let me see your stance. Your arms are too far apart. See, if you move them closer together you protect your center. You got it?
Aang:: Oh... yeah. Thanks.
Katara:: Okay, let's see what you got.
Katara:: You make a fine octopus, Pupil Aang.
Chong:: Don't fall in love with a traveling girl. She'll leave you broke and broken hearted...
Chong:: Heh-hey! River people!
Katara:: We're not river people.
Chong:: You're not? Well then what kind of people are ya?
Aang:: Just... people.
Chong:: Aren't we all, brother? Whoo.
Sokka:: Who're you?
Chong:: I'm Chong, and this is my wife Lily. We're nomads, happy to go wherever the wind takes us!
Aang:: You guys are nomads That's great! I'm a nomad.
Chong:: Hey, me too.
Aang:: I know... you just said that.
Chong:: Oh. underwear.
Zuko:: I didn't find anything to eat. I can't live like this. I wasn't meant to be a fugitive. This is impossible!
Zuko:: Uncle... what are you doing?
Iroh:: You're looking at the rare white dragon bush. Its leaves make a tea so delicious it's heartbreaking! That, or it's the white jade bush, which is poisonous.
Zuko:: We need food, not tea. I'm going fishing.
Iroh:: Delectable tea? Or deadly poison?
Aang:: Hey, Sokka, you should hear some of these stories. These guys have been everywhere.
Chong:: Well, not everywhere, Little Arrowhead. But where we haven't been we've heard about through stories and songs.
Aang:: They said they'll take us to see a giant night crawler.
Moku:: On the way there's a waterfall that creates a never-ending rainbow.
Sokka:: Look, I hate to be the wet blanket here, but since Katara is busy I guess it's up to me. We need to get to Omashu. No sidetracks, no worms, and definitely no rainbows.
Chong:: Whoa... sounds like someone's got a case of "destination fever," heh. You're worried too much about where you're going.
Lily:: You've gotta focus less on the "where" and more on the "going."
Sokka:: O. Ma. Shu.
Katara:: Sokka's right. We need to find King Bumi so Aang can learn earthbending somewhere safe.
Chong:: Well, sounds like you're headed to Omashu. There's an old story about a secret pass... ...right through the mountains.
Katara:: Is this real or a legend?
Chong:: Oh, it's a real legend. And it's as old as earthbending itself. Two lovers, forbidden from one another... a war divides their people, and a mountain divides them apart. Built a path to be together. Yeah, and I forget the next couple of lines, but then it goes... Secret tunnel! Secret tunnel! Through the mountain! Secret, secret, secret, secret tunnel! Yeah!
Sokka:: I think we'll just stick with flying. We've dealt with the Fire Nation before. We'll be fine.
Aang:: Yeah. Thanks for the help, but Appa hates going underground and we need to do whatever makes Appa most comfortable.
Commander:: Launch!
Aang, Sokka, and Katara:: AAAAAHHHHH!
Sokka:: Secret love cave. Let's go.
Iroh:: Zuko, remember that plant that I thought might be tea?
Zuko:: You didn't!
Iroh:: I did. And it wasn't.
Zuko:: Yah!
Iroh:: When the rash spreads to my throat, I will stop breathing. But look what I found! These are bacui berries, known to cure the poison of the white jade plant. That, or macahoni berries that cause blindness.
Zuko:: We're not taking any more chances with these plants! We need to get help.
Iroh:: But where are we going to go? We're enemies of the Earth Kingdom, and fugitives from the Fire Nation.
Zuko:: If the Earth Kingdom, discovers us, they'll have us killed.
Iroh:: But if the Fire Nation discovers us, we'll be turned over to Azula.
Zuko:: Earth Kingdom it is.
Sokka:: How far are we from the tunnel.
Chong:: Actually, it's not just one tunnel. The lovers didn't want anyone to find out about their love, so they built a whole labyrinth.
Sokka:: Labyrinth !
Chong:: I'm sure we'll figure it out.
Lily:: All you need to do is trust in love. According to the curse.
Sokka:: Curse!
Chong:: Hey-hey, we're here!
Sokka:: What exactly is this curse?
Chong:: The curse says that only those who trust in love can make it through the caves. Otherwise you'll be trapped in them forever.
Lily:: And die.
Chong:: Oh, yeah, and die. Hey, I just remembered the rest of that song. And die!
Sokka:: That's it! There's no way we're going througbrh some cursed hole!
Moku:: Hey, someone's making a big campfire!
Katara:: That's no campfire, Moku.
Sokka:: That's Fire Nation. They're tracking us.
Aang:: So all you need is to trust in love to get through these caves?
Chong:: That is correct, Master Arrowhead.
Aang:: We can make it.
Sokka:: Everyone into the hole!
Commander:: Hold on! It's too dangerous. Haven't you heard the song? Just close them in. The mountain will take care of the rest.
Katara:: It's okay, Appa. We'll be fine. I hope.
Sokka:: We will be fine. All we need is a plan. Chong, how long do those torches last?
Chong:: Eh, about two hours each.
Lily:: And we have five torches so that's... ten hours.
Sokka:: It doesn't work like that if they're all lit at the same time!
Lily:: Ohh, right.
Sokka:: I'm gonna make a map to keep track of exactly where we've been. Then we should be able to solve it like a maze and get through.
Song:: You two must not be from around here. We know better than to touch the white jade, much less make it into tea and drink it.
Iroh:: Heh heh heh. Whoops!
Song:: So where are you traveling from?
Zuko:: Yes, we're travelers.
Song:: Do you have names?
Zuko:: Names Of course we have names. I'm... Lee. And this is my uncle, uh... Mushi.
Iroh:: Yes, but my nephew was named after his father, so we just call him Junior.
Song:: Mushi and Junior, huh? My name is Song. You two look like you could use a good meal. Why don't you stay for dinner
Zuko:: Sorry, but we need to be moving on.
Song:: That's too bad. My mom always makes too much roast duck.
Iroh:: Where do you live, exactly?
Katara:: Sokka, this is the tenth dead end you've led us to.
Sokka:: This doesn't make any sense; we already came through this way.
Chong:: We don't need a map. We just need love. The little guy knows it.
Aang:: Yeah, but I wouldn't mind a map, also.
Sokka:: There's something strange here. There's only one explanation. The tunnels are changing.
Song's Mother:: My daughter tells me you're refugees. We were once refugees ourselves.
Song:: When I was a little girl, the Fire Nation raided our farming village. All the men were taken away. That was the last time I saw my father.
Zuko:: I haven't seen my father in many years.
Song:: Oh. Is he fighting in the war?
Zuko:: Yeah.
Chong:: The tunnels... they're a-changin'. Ah, it must be the curse. I we shouldn't have come down here.
Sokka:: Right. If only we listened to .
Katara:: Everyone be quiet. Listen.
Chong:: It's a giant flying thing with teeth!
Moku:: No! It's a wolf-bat!
Chong:: Yeah, it's no use. We're separated. But at least you have us, heh heh.
Sokka:: Noooooooo!
Song:: Can I join you? I know what you've been through. We've all been through it. The Fire Nation has hurt you.
Song:: It's okay. They've hurt me, too.
Chong:: Oh, don't let the cave in get you down. Don't let the falling rocks turn your smile into a frown. When the tunnels are darkest that's when you need a clown, hey! Don't let the cave in get you down, Sokka!
Katara:: Aang, look!
Aang:: We found the exit!
Katara:: This isn't the exit.
Aang:: No... it's a tomb.
Aang:: It must be the two lovers from the legend. That's who's buried here.
Katara:: These pictures tell their story.
Katara:: They met on top of the mountain that divided their two villages.
Katara:: The villages were enemies so they could not be together.
Katara:: But their love was strong and they found a way.
Katara:: The two lovers learned earthbending from the badger moles. They became the first earthbenders.
Katara:: They built elaborate tunnels so they could meet secretly. Anyone who tried to follow them would be lost forever in the labyrinth.
Katara:: But one day the man didn't come.
Katara:: He died in the war between their two villages.
Katara:: Devastated, the woman unleashed a terrible display of her earthbending power. She could have destroyed them all.
Katara:: But instead she declared the war over.
Katara:: Both villages helped her build a new city where they would live together in peace.
Katara:: The woman's name was Oma and the man's name was Shu. The great city was named Omashu as a monument to their love.
Katara:: Love is brightest in the dark.
Moku:: Oh, great! Your plans have led us to another dead end!
Sokka:: At least I'm thinking of ideas and trying to get us out of here, Moku.
Chong:: Whoa, whoa, wait a minute; we're thinking of ideas! 'Cause I've had an idea for, like, an hour now.
Sokka:: Yes! We're all thinking of ideas!
Chong:: Well, then listen to this: if love is the key out of here, then all we need to do is play a love song.
Aang:: How are we gonna find our way out of these tunnels?
Katara:: I have a crazy idea.
Aang:: What?
Katara:: Never mind, it's too crazy.
Aang:: Katara, what is it?
Katara:: I was thinking... the curse says we'll be trapped in here forever unless we trust in love.
Aang:: Right...
Katara:: And here it says 'love is brightest in the dark' and... has a picture of them kissing.
Aang:: Where are you going with this?
Katara:: Well... what if we kissed?
Aang:: Us, kissing?
Katara:: See? It was a crazy idea.
Aang:: Us... kissing...
Katara:: Us kissing. What was I thinking? Can you imagine that?
Aang:: Yeah, heh, heh. I definitely wouldn't wanna kiss you!
Katara:: Oh, well I didn't realize it was such a horrible option. Sorry I suggested it!
Aang:: No, no, I mean... if there was a choice between kissing you and dying...
Aang:: What? I'm saying I'd rather kiss you than die. That's a compliment.
Katara:: Well, I'm not sure which I would rather do!
Aang:: What is wrong with me?
Chong:: Even if you're lost you can't lose the love because it's in your heart, ooooohhhhh...
Iroh:: Thank you for the duck. It was excellent.
Song's Mother:: You're welcome. It brings me joy to see someone eat my cooking with such... gusto.
Iroh:: Much practice. Junior, where are your manners? You need to thank these nice people.
Zuko:: Thank you.
Song:: I know you don't think there's any hope left in the world, but there is hope. The Avatar has returned!
Zuko:: I know.
Iroh:: What are you doing? These people just showed you great kindness.
Zuko:: They're about to show us a little more kindness. Well?
Aang:: We're gonna run out of light any second now, aren't we?
Katara:: I think so.
Aang:: Then what are we gonna do?
Katara:: What can we do?
Chong:: Hey-hey, you saved us, Sokka!
Sokka:: No, they were trying to get away from something.
Chong:: From what?
Chong:: Hey, those things are music lovers!
Sokka:: Badger moles, coming toward me. Come on guys, help me out.
Chong:: The big bad badger moles who work in the tunnels, hate the wolf bats but love the sounds.
Aang:: It's made of some kind of crystals. They must only light up in the dark!
Katara:: That's how the two lovers found each other. They just put out their lights and followed the crystals.
Katara:: That must be the way out!
Aang:: So... um...
Katara:: Let's go!
Aang:: What about Sokka?
Katara:: Sokka!
Sokka:: How did you guys get out?
Aang:: Just like the legend says: we let love lead the way.
Sokka:: Really? We let huge ferocious beasts lead our way.
Katara:: Why is your forehead all red?
Chong:: Nobody react to what I'm about to tell you. I think that kid might be the Avatar.
Aang:: So, are you guys gonna come to Omashu with us?
Moku:: Nope.
Aang:: Okay. Thanks for everything, Moku.
Chong:: Sokka, I hope you learned a little something about not letting the plans get in the way of the journey.
Sokka:: Just play your songs.
Chong:: Hey, good plan! Even if you're lost you can't lose the love because it's in your heart. Ooooohhhh...
Sokka:: The journey was long and annoying, but now you get to see what it's really about - the destination.
Sokka:: I present to you the Earth Kingdom city of O... Oh, no...
