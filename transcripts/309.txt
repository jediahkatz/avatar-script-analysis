Sokka::  This is it, the official rendezvous point for the invasion force.
Toph:: How did you pick this place?
Sokka:: Before we split up, my dad and I found this island on a map. It's uninhabited, and the harbor  surrounded by cliffs seemed like the perfect secluded place.
Katara::  Nice choice Sokka. And we're here four days ahead of schedule.
Aang::  Wait,  four days!  The invasion's in four days!
Sokka::  Whatever.  That's like... four days from now.  Let's just calm down, and ...
Katara:: Sokka's got the right idea Aang. We're here, we're ready...  the best thing we can do now is get plenty of rest.
Aang:: Uh..  I guess.
Aang::  Your days of tyranny are over Fire Lord. I'm bringing you down!
Fire Lord Ozai:: Really ,  how do you plan on doing that  when you're not even wearing pants!
Aang::  Uah!  It was just a dream Momo, I still have my pants.   Well, I better keep training.
1st Servant::  Fresh fruit, Prince Zuko?
2nd Servant::  May I wash your feet, sir?
1st Servant:: Head massage?
2nd  Servant::  Hot towel?
Palanquin Servant:: Prince Zuko, is something wrong? You didn't take the palanquin.
Zuko:: I'm just going to Mai's house, it's not far.
Palanquin Servant:: It's not a Prince's place to walk anywhere, sir.
Katara:: Hey, how long have you been up?
Aang:: A couple hours.  I got a lot more skills to refine if I'm going to fight Ozai.
Katara::  You know there is such a thing as over-training.
Aang:: You don't get it, do you?  My form is bad. I'm sloppy. And I still don't know any firebending, not even the basics.
Sokka:: That's okay Aang. The eclipse will block all firebending anyway, you don't need to know any.  Plus it's a stupid element.
Aang:: Okay,  well, I still have to work on everything else. I'd better spend the whole day training.
Aang::  Good night Katara. Good night Sokka. Good night Toph. Good night Appa. Good night Momo. Good night Appa and Momo.
Toph::  Go to sleep already!
Aang::  Your days of tyranny are over Fire Lord. I'm bringing you down... and this time I brought pants.
Fire Lord Ozai::  So it seems.  But are you prepared for your mathematics test?
Aang::  Math test?! Oh no!  I forgot all about the math test!  I've got to be ready!
Katara:: Aang, it's the middle of the night. You need to go back to sleep.
Aang::  But I forgot my pants and my math test.
Katara::  Aang, sleep. Please...for me.
Zuko:: Tell me, if you can have anything you wanted right now, what would it be?
Mai:: Hmm. A big fancy fruit tart, with rose petals on top.
Zuko::  You know, being a prince and all, I might just be able to make that happen.
Mai::  That would be impressive.
Zuko:: Do you think  you can find a fresh fruit tart for the lady, with rose petals on top.
Royal Servant::  Excellent choice, sir.
Mai::  I guess there are some perks that come with being royalty.  Though, there is annoying stuff too, like that all-day war meeting coming up.
Zuko::  War meeting? What are you talking about?
Mai:: Azula mentioned something,  I assumed you were going too.
Zuko::  I guess I wasn't invited.
Fire Lord Ozai:: Wake up Aang.  You missed the invasion.
Aang:: Sokka get up! I need to know what day it is!
Sokka:: What?!  Who's talking?!
Toph::  Relax, it's still two days before the invasion.
Aang::  Sokka, you've got to get up and drill your rock climbing exercises.
Sokka:: What?
Aang::  In one of my dreams, you were running from fire nation soldiers, trying to climb this cliff, but you  were too slow and they got you.
Sokka:: But that was just a dream,  I'm a great climber.
Aang::   Then climb that cliff. Climb it fast!
Sokka::  Stupid Avatar. Stupid cliff. Stupid dream! I can climb fast!
Aang::  Don't drink that!
Toph::  Why, is it poisoned?
Aang:: In my dream, we were right in the middle of the invasion, and you had to stop to use the bathroom. We died because of your tiny bladder.  And you  need to start wearing your hair up.  In my dream, your hair got caught in a train, and...
Katara::  Aang, I know you're just trying to help. But you really need to get a grip. You're unraveling.
Aang:: You're right. I'm losing my mind.
Sokka:: Ahhh!
Aang:: It's like every time I think about how stressed I am,  I just end up more stressed.  I'm like a big, growing snowball of nerves.
Sokka::  Of course you are. That's 'cause you've got to fight the Fire Lord,  the baddest man on the planet. And you better win, or we're all done for.
Katara:: Sokka, you're not helping!
Sokka::  What? It's true. That's the deal, he knows it.
Katara:: You know what? I've got just the thing.  Get ready to be "de-stress-i-fied".  These yoga stretches can really work wonders if you do them in extreme heat. Reach up.  Reach for the sun.  Feel your chi paths clearing.  Now close your eyes. How are you feeling?
Aang::  I feel...really warm.
Katara:: Good, good. Go on.
Aang:: Like there's the warm feeling all around me. This heat... like I'm in the Fire Lord's palace, and he's shooting a bunch of fire balls at me. And the whole world is being engulfed in flames.
Katara:: Maybe your stress is the kind you need to talk out.
Sokka::  Why don't you get right down to business and tell me what's been bothering you.
Aang::  You know what's bothering me. I have to fight the Fire Lord in a few days.
Sokka:: Mhm.  Tell me more about this, 'Fire Lord.' Why are you so afraid of him?
Aang::  You said it yourself. He's the baddest man on the planet. I'm supposed to defeat him and save the world.
Sokka:: Hmm.  Life does feel that way some times, doesn't it?  Like we're all trying to save the world from evil.
Aang:: Okay, but what can I do to feel better?
Sokka:: Want to try screaming into this pillow?
Azula:: Hello Zu-zu. If you've come for a royal hair combing, I'm afraid you'll have to wait.
Zuko:: So I guess there's a big war meeting coming up, huh. And apparently I'm not welcome there.
Azula:: What do you mean? Of course you're welcome there.
Zuko::  Oh yeah? I guess that's why no one bothered to tell me about it.
Azula:: Oh Zuko, don't be so dramatic. I'm certain Dad wants you there. You probably weren't invited, because it's so obvious that you're supposed to be there.
Zuko::  Well, were you invited?
Azula::  Of course. I'm the Princess.
Zuko::  And I'm the Prince!
Azula:: Exactly, so stop acting  like a paranoid child.  Just go to the meeting.
Zuko:: Forget it, I'm not going.
Toph:: Alright, what you need is a good old fashioned back poundin' to relieve your stress.
Aang:: Pound away.  Ahh! Ow! Uh! Toph!  I ... think ... this ... is ... bruising ... me!
Toph:: Sorry, I forgot you have baby skin.  Well, there's one other thing we can try...  acupuncture!
Aang::  Ahhhh!
Mai:: Zuko, it's just a dumb meeting. Who cares?
Zuko:: I don't.
Mai:: Well good. You shouldn't. Why would you even want to go?  Just think about how things went to the last war meeting you went to.
Zuko::  I know.
Mai::  You know what will make you feel better? Ordering some servants around! I might be hungry for a whole tray of fruit tarts! And maybe a little palanquin ride around town... Double time!
Aang:: Thanks for everything guys.
Katara::  So do you feel less stressed? Ready for a good night sleep?
Aang::  Uhh...I kinda think I sorta might ... slightly feel a little better ... maybe.
Sokka::  Then our work here is done.
Katara::  What happened Aang?
Aang::  It's the nightmares. They just get worse and worse.
Sokka::  Looks like it's time for...  another therapy session.
Aang::  No, that won't help. Nothing helps.  There's only one thing I can do. I'm going to stay awake straight through to the invasion.
Aang:: Invasion. All aboard for the invasion.
Katara:: You don't look so good.  You sure you can't just lie down for a little nap?
Aang::  I told you, I can't go back to sleep.
Katara:: Aang, staying up can't be good for you.
Aang:: Actually staying up all night has given me some time to think.  And I've realized some big things Katara.
Katara::  What big things?
Aang::  I see everything so clearly now... what really matters. Why I'm really doing this. I'm doing it to save the world,   but more than that. I'm doing it for the people I love.   I'm doing it for you Katara.
Katara:: Aang, what are you saying?
Aang:: I'm saying...I love you.
Katara:: What are we doing?
Aang:: What our hearts  have been telling us to do for a long, long time. Baby,  you're my forever girl.
Katara:: Aang?
Aang:: Huh?
Katara:: I was just saying you should take a nap.
Aang:: Oh,  I guess I kinda drifted off into a day-dream.
Katara:: What was your dream about?
Aang::  Uhh, living under water?
Katara::  Sounds neat.
Aang::  Heh. Phew.
Messenger:: Prince Zuko,  everyone's waiting for you.
Zuko::  What?
Messenger:: The high admirals, high generals, the war ministers, and the princess have all arrived.  You're the only person missing.
Zuko::  So, my dad wants me at the meeting?
Royal Messenger:: The Fire Lord said he would not start until you arrived, sir.
Aang:: Put 'em up, Fire Lord.
Sokka:: Hey, I'm trying to build Appa some armor here so he doesn't have to go into the invasion naked. He's your bison ...
Aang::  Ozai's defense is impeccable. I'll have to try a different approach.  You think you're untouchable, don't you Mr. Fire Lord.
Voice:: Boy, you are really starting to lose it kid.
Aang:: Momo, did you hear something.
Momo:: No, but I said something.
Aang:: Uhh.
Momo:: You my friend are just a few plumbs short of a fruit pie.
Aang:: That's more like it.  I'm so tired, that for a second there I imagined you were talking to me.  Oh, Momo... let me explain.
Katara:: Aang  We're all starting to get a little worried about you.
Sokka::  You've been awake too long.
Toph::  And you're acting downright weird.
Appa::  You've got to take care of yourself. You can't go on like this.
Aang:: Uhh.  I appreciate what you guys are saying. But the stress and the nightmares, they were too much. Staying awake is the best way for me to deal with it.
Momo::  Yeah, leave the kid alone.
Appa::  Hey, who asked you?
Aang:: Guys...come on.
Appa::  No! I'm sick of this guy always mouthing off, (Cut to shot of Momo who is very mad  and telling me what to do.
Aang:: Oh, you don't like i?  Well let's go right now.
Aang:: Sokka, what should we do?
Sokka:: About what?
Aang:: About that!
Koala Sheep:: Appa! Appa! Appa!
Koala Sheep:: Momo! Momo! Momo!
Aang:: Come on guys,   we're all on the same side!
Guru Pathik:: Chakras, chakras, everybody loves chakras!  Chakras, chakras... chakra sandwich tastes good, yum!
Koala Sheep:: Yay! Yay! Yay! Yay! Yay!
Aang:: Huh? Huh!
Koala Sheep:: Yay! Yay! Yay!
Aang::  I just need a jump in a cold waterfall.
Mai:: So, how did it go?
Zuko:: When I got to the meeting, everyone welcomed me.   My father had saved me a seat. He wanted me next to him.  I was literally at his right hand.
Mai:: Zuko, that's wonderful.  You must be happy?
Zuko:: During the meeting, I was the perfect prince.  The son my father wanted. But I wasn't me.
Aang:: Oh look, another hallucination. An imaginary bed, made out of clouds.
Toph:: Hey! It's real! We spent hours working on it.
Sokka:: We made it for you.  A good night sleep will probably take the crazy away... we hope.
Aang:: Look, you guys keep telling me I need to sleep, but I can't, the invasion's tomorrow.
Katara::  Aang...
Aang::  No Katara, there's still so much I haven't learned. I don't need sleep. What I need is practice. Quick, hit me.
Katara:: I'm not going to hit you.
Toph::  You want me to do it?
Katara:: Listen to me,  you've been training for this since the day we've met. I've seen your progress. You're smart, brave, and strong enough.
Aang::  You really think so?
Sokka::  We all do. You can do this. You're ready.
Toph:: You're the man,  Twinkle-toes.
Aang:: Thanks guys.  You know what? I think I am ready.
Aang::  Your days of tyranny are over, Fire Lord.
Fire Lord Ozai::  Really? You're going to take me out? You're not even wearing pants.
Aang::  No Fire Lord Ozai,  you're not wearing pants.
Fire Lord Ozai::  No!  My royal parts are showing!
