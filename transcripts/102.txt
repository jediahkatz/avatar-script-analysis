Children:: Yay! Aang's back!
Katara:: Aang didn't do anything. It was an accident.
Aang:: Yeh, we were on the ship and there was this booby trap and well...  ...we “boobied” right into it.
Aang:: Don't blame Katara! I brought her there.  It's my fault.
Sokka:: Aha! The traitor confesses! Warriors, away from the enemy!  The foreigner is banned from our village!
Sokka:: No! I'm keeping my promise to Dad. I'm protecting you from threats like him!
Sokka:: Fun? We can't fight firebenders with fun!
Sokka:: Get out of our village. Now!
Katara:: Grandmother, please, don't let Sokka do this.
Gran Gran:: Katara, you knew going on that ship was forbidden. Sokka is right. I think it best if the airbender leaves.
Katara:: Then I'm banished too!
Katara:: C'mon, Aang, let's go!
Katara:: To find a waterbender! Aang is taking me to the North Pole!
Sokka:: Katara!  Would you really choose him over your tribe? Your own family?
Aang:: Katara, I don't want to come between you and your family.
Katara:: So, you're leaving the South Pole? This is goodbye?
Aang:: Thanks for penguin sledding with me.
Katara:: Where will you go?
Aang:: It was nice meeting everyone.
Sokka:: Let's see your bison fly now, air boy.
Aang:: Come on, Appa, you can do it! Yip! Yip!
Sokka:: Yeh, I thought so.
Aang:: Come on, boy.
Gran Gran:: Katara, you'll feel better after you –
Sokka:: All right! Ready our defenses! The Fire Nation could be on our shores any moment now!
Little Boy:: But, I gotta –
Aang:: Yeh, I liked her too.
Aang:: The village!  Appa, wait here!
Sokka:: Ohhh, man!
Katara:: Sokka, get out of the way!
Zuko:: Where are you hiding him?
Zuko:: He'd be about this age? Master of all elements?
Zuko:: I know you're hiding him!
Little Boy:: Show no fear!
Aang:: Hey Katara. Hey Sokka.
Aang:: Looking for me?
Katara:: Aang?
Sokka:: No way.
Zuko:: I've spent years preparing for this encounter. Training. Meditating. You're just a child!
Aang:: Well, you're just a teenager.
Aang:: If I go with you, will you promise to leave everyone alone?
Katara:: No, Aang! Don't do this!
Aang:: Don't worry, Katara, it'll be okay.   Take care of Appa for me until I get back.
Zuko:: Head a course to the Fire Nation. I'm going home.
Katara:: We have to go after that ship, Sokka. Aang saved our tribe; now we have to save him.
Sokka:: Katara, I—
Katara:: Why can't you realize that he's on our side? If we don't help him, no one will. I know you don't like Aang, but we owe him and I—
Sokka:: Katara! Are you gonna talk all day or are you comin' with me?
Sokka:: Get in. We're going to save your boyfriend.
Katara:: He's not my—
Sokka:: Whatever.
Gran Gran:: You'll need these. You have a long journey ahead of you. It's been so long since I've had hope. But you brought it back to life, my little waterbender.  And you, my brave warrior, be nice to your sister.
Sokka:: Yeah... okay, Gran.
Gran Gran:: Aang is the Avatar. He's the world's only chance. You both found him for a reason. Now your destinies are intertwined with his.
Katara:: Appa!
Sokka:: You just love taking me out of my comfort zone, don't ya?
Zuko:: This staff will make an excellent gift for my father. I suppose you wouldn't know of fathers, being raised by monks. Take the Avatar to the prison hold. And  take this to my quarters.
Iroh:: Hey, you mind taking this to his quarters for me?
Aang:: So... I guess you never fought an airbender before. I bet I can take you both with my hands tied behind my back.
Guard 1:: Silence!
Guard 2:: The Avatar has escaped!
Katara:: Please, Appa, we need your help. Aang needs your help.
Sokka:: Up. Ascend. Elevate.
Katara:: Sokka doesn't believe you can fly, but I do, Appa.   Come on. Don't you wanna save Aang?
Sokka:: What was it that kid said? Yee-ha? Hup hup? Wahoo? Uh... yip yip?
Sokka:: He's flying! He's flying! Katara, he's—!  I mean, big deal, he's flying.
Aang:: Thanks anyway!
Aang:: My staff!
Zuko:: Looks like I underestimated you.
Zuko:: What is that?
Aang:: Appa!
Sokka:: Now that was some waterbending!
Sokka:: Well, I couldn't let you have all the glory.
Aang:: I dropped my staff.
Sokka:: Got it!
Sokka:: Ha! That's from the Water Tribe!
Sokka:: Katara!
Katara:: Hurry up, Sokka!
Sokka:: Yip yip! Yip yip!
Zuko:: Shoot them down!
Iroh:: Good news for the Fire Lord. The nation's greatest threat is just a little kid.
Zuko:: That kid, Uncle, just did this.  I won't underestimate him again. Dig this ship out and follow them!   As soon as you're done with that.
Katara:: How did you do that? With the water? It was the most amazing thing I've ever seen.
Katara:: Why didn't you tell us you were the Avatar?
Aang:: Because... I never wanted to be.
Katara:: But Aang, the world's been waiting for the Avatar to return and finally put an end to this war.
Katara:: According to legend, you need to first master water, then earth, then fire, right?
Aang:: That's what the monks told me.
Katara:: Well, if we go to the North Pole you can master waterbending.
Katara:: And Sokka, I'm sure you'll get to knock some firebender heads on the way.
Katara:: Then we're in this together.
Katara:: What's there?
Aang:: Here  we'll ride the hopping llamas. Then waaaay over here  we'll surf on the backs of giant koi fish. Then back over here we'll ride the hog-monkeys. They don't like people riding them, but that's what makes it fun!
