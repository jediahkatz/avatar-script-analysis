Zuko:: More ferocious!
Zuko:: Imagine striking through your opponent's heart.
Aang:: Ugh! I'm trying.
Zuko:: Now let me hear you roar like a tiger-dillo!
Zuko:: That sounded pathetic!  I said roar!
Katara:: Who wants a nice, cool glass of watermelon juice?
Aang:: Ooo, ooo,  me, me, me!
Zuko:: Hey,  your lesson's not over yet!  Get back here.
Suki::  Come on, Zuko.  Just take a break. What's the big deal?
Zuko:: Fine.
Zuko:: If you want to lounge around  like a bunch of snail-sloths all day, then go ahead!
Sokka::  Maybe Zuko's right.  Sitting around the house has made us pretty lazy. But I know  just the thing to change that. Beach party!
Aang::  Check out my Appa sand sculpture.
Toph:: Not bad, baldy. But I've been working on my sandbending  You're gonna love this.
Aang:: Whoa.  Wow, you even made a little Earth King and Bosco.
Toph:: Try and top that, Sokka.
Sokka:: Ta-da!
Aang:: Is that a blubbering, blob monster?
Sokka:: No,  it's Suki.
Toph:: Suki, we'll all understand if you break up with him over this.
Suki:: I think it's sweet.
Aang:: But it doesn't even look like...
Aang:: What are you doing?!
Zuko::  Teaching you a lesson!
Katara:: What happened?
Sokka:: Zuko's gone crazy! I made a sand sculpture of Suki  and he destroyed it! Oh, and he's attacking Aang.
Aang:: Get a grip before I blast you off this roof!
Zuko:: Go ahead and do it!
Aang::  Enough!
Katara:: What's wrong with you?!  You could have hurt Aang.
Zuko:: What's wrong with me? What's wrong with all of you!  How can you sit around having beach parties when Sozin's Comet  is only 3 days away!
Zuko:: Why are you all looking at me like I'm crazy?
Aang:: About Sozin's Comet...  I was actually going to wait to fight the Fire Lord until after it came.
Zuko:: After?
Aang:: I'm not ready.  I need more time to master firebending.
Toph:: And frankly, your earthbending could still use some work too.
Zuko:: So... You all knew Aang was going to wait?
Sokka:: Honestly, if Aang tries to fight the Fire Lord right now, he's gonna lose. No offence.
Katara:: The whole point of fighting the Fire Lord before the comet was to stop the Fire Nation from winning the war. But they pretty much won the war when they took Ba Sing Se. Things can't get any worse.
Zuko:: You're wrong.  It's about to get worse than you can even imagine.
Zuko::  The day before the eclipse, my Father asked me to attend an important war meeting.  It was what I dreamed about  and wanted  for so many years. My Father  had finally accepted me back.
Fire Lord Ozai:: Welcome, Prince Zuko. We waited for you.
Fire Lord Ozai:: General Shinu, your report.
General Shinu::  Thank you, sir.  Ba Sing Se is still under our control.  However, earthbender rebellions have prevented us from achieving total victory in the Earth Kingdom.
Fire Lord Ozai::  What is your recommendation?
General Shinu:: Our army is spread too thin but once the eclipse is over and the invasion defeated, we should transfer more domestic forces into the Earth Kingdom.
Fire Lord Ozai:: Hmm...  Prince Zuko,  you've been among the Earth Kingdom commoners. Do you think that adding more troops will stop these rebellions?
Zuko::  The people of the Earth Kingdom are proud and strong. They can endure anything as long as they have hope.
Fire Lord Ozai:: Yes, you're right.  We need to destroy their hope.
Zuko::  Well, that's not exactly what I...
Azula::  I think you should take their precious hope  and the rest of their land,  and burn it all to the ground.
Fire Lord Ozai:: Yes...  Yes, you're right, Azula. Sozin's Comet is almost upon us  and on that day it will endow us with the strength and power of a hundred Suns. No bender will stand a chance against us.
General Shinu::  What are you suggesting, sir?
Fire Lord Ozai:: When the comet last came, my grandfather, Fire Lord Sozin, used it to wipe out the Air Nomads. Now, I will use its power to end the Earth Kingdom.  Permanently.  From our airships,  we will rain fire over their lands. A fire that will destroy .  And out of the ashes,  a new World will be born. A World in which the lands are Fire Nation and am  the supreme ruler of everything!
Zuko::  I wanted to speak out against this horrifying plan.  But I'm ashamed to say I didn't.  My whole life I struggled to gain my Father's love and acceptance.  But once I had it, I realized I lost myself getting there.  I forgotten who I was.
Katara:: I can't believe this.
Sokka:: I always knew that the Fire Lord was a bad guy but his plan is just pure evil.
Aang:: What am I going to do?
Zuko:: I know you're scared.  And I know that you're not ready to save the World. But if you don't defeat the Fire Lord before the comet comes,  there won't be a World to save anymore.
Aang:: Why  didn't you tell me  about your Dad's crazy plan sooner?
Zuko::  I didn't think I had to. I assumed that you were still going to fight him before the comet. No one told me you decided to wait!
Aang:: This is bad.  This is really,  really bad.
Katara::  Aang, you  don't have to do this alone.
Toph:: Yeah.  If we all fight the Fire Lord together, we got a shot at taking him down.
Sokka:: Alright!  Team Avatar is back!  Air.  Water.  Earth.  Fire.  Fan  and sword!
Aang:: Fighting the Fire Lord is going to be the hardest thing we've ever done together. But I wouldn't want to do it any other way.
Toph:: Yeah.
Sokka:: Alright.
Katara:: Get over here, Zuko. Being part of the group also means being part of group hugs.
Zuko:: There's one technique you need  to know before facing my Father. How to redirect lightning.  If you let the energy in your own body flow,  the lightning will follow it.  You turn your opponent's energy against them.
Aang:: That's like waterbending.
Zuko:: Exactly. My Uncle  invented this technique himself by studying waterbenders.
Aang:: So... Have you ever redirected lightning before?
Zuko:: Once. Against my Father.
Aang:: What did it feel like?
Zuko:: Exhilarating.  But terrifying.  You feel so powerful  holding that much energy in your body. But you know that you make the wrong move, it's over.
Aang:: Heh.  Well, not over over, right I mean there's always Katara and a little spirit water  action... Am I right?
Katara::  Actually I used it all up after Azula shot you.
Aang:: Oh.
Zuko::  You'll have to take the Fire Lord's life. Before he takes yours.
Aang:: Yeah... I'll just do that.
Sokka::  Gather round Team Avatar.  In order to take out the Fire Lord, or in this case, the "Melon Lord", our timing has to be perfect.  First, Suki and I will draw his fire.  Then, Katara and Zuko  charge in with some liquidy hot offence and while the "Melon Lord" is distracted, Aang swoops in and "BAM!"  He delivers the final blow.
Toph:: Err...  what about me?
Sokka::  For now, you're the Melon Lord's forces.
Toph:: So I get to chuck flaming rocks at all of you?
Sokka:: Whatever makes the training feel more realistic.
Toph:: Sweetness.
Toph:: Muahahahahahaha!
Sokka::  Watch it, Toph!
Toph::  I am not Toph, I am "Melon Lord"! Muahahahahaha!
Sokka::  Now, Aang!
Zuko::  What are you waiting for? Take him out!
Aang::  I can't.
Sokka:: What's wrong with you?  If this was the real deal,  you'd be shot full of lightning  right now.
Aang:: I'm sorry, but it just didn't feel right. I didn't feel like myself.
Sokka::  There.  That's how it's done.
Katara:: I have a surprise for everyone!
Toph::  I knew it! You did have a secret thing with Haru!
Katara:: Er, no.  I was looking for cooking pots in the attic and I found this.  Look at baby Zuko!  Isn't he cute?
Katara::  Oh lighten up, I was just teasing.
Zuko::  That's not me. It's my Father.
Suki::  But he looked so sweet and innocent.
Zuko:: Well that sweet little kid grew up to be a monster. And the worst Father in the history of Fathers.
Aang:: But he is still a human being.
Zuko:: You're going to defend him?
Aang:: No, I agree with you. Fire Lord Ozai  is a horrible person and the World will probably be better off without him. There's gotta be another way.
Zuko::  Like what?
Aang::  I don't know. Maybe  we can make some big pots of glue and then I can use gluebending to stick his arms and legs together so he can't bend anymore.
Zuko::  Yeah. Then you can show him his baby pictures and all those happy memories  will make him good again.
Aang::  Do you really think that would work?
Zuko::  No!
Aang::  This goes against  everything I learned from the monks. I can't just go around wiping out people I don't like...
Sokka:: Sure, you can. You're the Avatar. If it's in the name of keeping balance,  I'm pretty sure the Universe will forgive you.
Aang::  This isn't a joke, Sokka! None of you understands the position I'm in!
Katara:: Aang, we do understand. It's just...
Aang::  Just what, Katara?! What?
Katara::  We're trying to help.
Aang::  Then when you  figure out a way for me  to beat the Fire Lord without  taking his life, I love to hear it!
Katara:: Aang, don't walk away from this.
Zuko:: Let him go. He needs time to sort it out by himself.
Aang:: Hey, Momo.  I don't suppose you know what I should do.  I didn't think so.
Sokka:: Okay, that's everything.
Toph::  No, it's not.  Where's Aang?
Zuko::  Aang? Aang!
Toph:: Come on lazy bones, let's go.
Sokka::  He left his staff. That's so strange.
Zuko:: Aang's not in the house. Let's check the beach.
Sokka:: Look! There's his footprints.  The trail ends here.
Suki:: So... He went for a midnight swim and never came back?
Katara:: Maybe he was captured.
Sokka:: I don't think so. There's no sign of a struggle.
Toph::  I bet he ran away again.
Sokka:: Ah-uh. He left behind his glider and Appa.
Toph:: Then what do think happened to him oh sleuthy one?
Sokka:: It's pretty obvious.  Aang mysteriously disappears before an important battle? He's definitely on a Spirit World journey.
Zuko:: But if he was, wouldn't his body still be here?
Sokka::  Oh yeah, forgot about that.
Katara:: Then he's gotta be somewhere on Ember Island. Let's split up and look for him.
Toph::  I'm going with Zuko!  What? Everyone else went on a life changing fieldtrip with Zuko. Now it's my turn.
Actress Aang::  Avatar State, yip yip!
Toph::  And then when I was nine, I ran away again.
Zuko:: Uh-huh.
Toph:: I know I shouldn't complain,  my parents gave me everything that I ever asked for. But they never gave me the one thing that I really wanted. Their love. You know what I mean?
Zuko::  Look, I know you had a rough childhood but we should really focus on finding Aang.
Toph::  This is the worst fieldtrip ever.
Sokka:: Judging by the looks on your faces, I'm guessing you guys didn't find Aang either.
Zuko:: No. It's like he just... disappeared.
Toph::  Hey, wait a minute, has anyone noticed that Momo's missing too?
Sokka::  Oh no!  I knew it was only a matter of time. Appa ate Momo!  Momo,  I'm coming for ya, buddy
Katara::  Sokka, Appa didn't eat Momo. He's probably with Aang.
Sokka::  That's just what Appa wants you to think.
Zuko::  Get out of the bison's mouth, Sokka.  We have a real problem here. Aang is nowhere to be found and the comet is only 2 days away.
Katara::  What should we do Zuko?
Zuko::  I don't know.  Why are you all looking at me?
Katara::  Well, you are kind of the expert on tracking Aang.
Toph:: Yeah, if anyone's got experience hunting the Avatar, it's you.
Sokka:: Zuko, I don't want to tell you how to do your job but why are we heading towards the Earth Kingdom? There's no way Aang's there.
Zuko::  Just trust me.
Azula:: Come on slowpokes, faster!  . .
Azula:: Sorry I'm late, Father. Good palanquin bearers  are so hard to come by these days. So, is everything ready for our departure?
Fire Lord Ozai::  There has been a change of plans, Azula.
Azula::  What?
Fire Lord Ozai::  I've decided to lead the fleet of airships to Ba Sing Se .  You will remain here in the Fire Nation.
Azula::  But I thought we were going to do this together.
Fire Lord Ozai::  My decision is .
Azula::  You...  you can't treat me like this.  You can't treat me like Zuko!
Fire Lord Ozai::  Azula, silence yourself.
Azula::  But it was my idea  to burn everything to the ground! I deserve to be by your side!
Fire Lord Ozai::  Azula!  Listen to me.  I need you here to watch over the homeland, it's a very important job  that I can only entrust to you.
Azula::  Really?
Fire Lord Ozai:: And for your loyalty,  I've decided to declare you the new Fire Lord.
Azula::  Fire Lord Azula?  It does seem appropriate. But, what about you?
Fire Lord Ozai::  Fire Lord Ozai is no more. Just as the World will be reborn in fire,  I shall be reborn  as the supreme ruler of the World.  From this moment on, I will be known as...  the "Phoenix King"!
Katara::  And the reason you brought us to a seedy Earth Kingdom tavern is what now?
Zuko:: June.
Sokka::  Oh yeah  that weird bounty hunter with the giant mole.
Suki::  Mole? Her skin is flawless.
Sokka::  No,  she has this giant mole creature she rides around on.
Zuko::  Her shirshu.  It's the only animal that can track Aang's scent anywhere in the World. It's the one shot we have of finding him.
Toph::  I don't know who this June lady is but  I like her.
Aang::  Hey Momo,  I just had the strangest dream.  Wait...
Aang::  Where are we?
