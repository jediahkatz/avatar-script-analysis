Katara::  Doesn't it seem kinda weird that we're hiding  from the Fire Lord in his own house?
Zuko::  I told you, my Father hasn't come here since our family was actually happy. And that was a long time ago. This is the last place anyone would think to look for us.
Sokka::  You guys are not going to believe this. There's a play about us.
Suki::  We were just in town and we found this poster.
Katara::  What?  How is that possible?
Sokka::  Listen to this.  "The Boy in the Iceberg is a new production from acclaimed playwright Pu On Tim who scoured  the globe gathering information on the Avatar from the icy South Pole to the heart of Ba Sing Se.  His sources including singing nomads, pirates, prisoners of war and a surprisingly knowledgeable merchant of cabbage."
Suki::  "Brought to you by the critically acclaimed Ember Island Players."
Zuko:: Ugh.  My Mother used to take us to see them. They butchered "Love Amongst The Dragons" every year.
Katara::  Sokka, do you really think it's a good idea for us to attend a play about ourselves?
Sokka:: Come on, a day at the theatre?  This is the kind of wacky time wasting nonsense I've been missing.
Aang:: Hey, uh... I wanted to sit  there.
Zuko::  Just sit next to me, what's the big deal?
Aang:: I was  just... I wanted to...  Okay.
Toph::  Why are we sitting in the nose bleed section? My feet  can't see a thing from up here.
Katara:: Don't worry, I'll tell your feet what's happening.
Actress Katara::  Sokka, my only brother. We constantly roam these icy South Pole seas and yet never do we find anything fulfilling.
Actor Sokka::  All I want is a full feeling in my stomach, I'm starving!
Actress Katara:: Is food the only thing on your mind?
Actor Sokka:: Well, I'm trying to get it out of my mind and  into my mouth. I'm starving. .
Sokka:: This is pathetic. My  jokes are way funnier than this.
Toph::  I think he's got you pegged.
Actress Katara:: Everyday, the World awaits a beacon to guide us, yet none appears. Still, we cannot give up hope.  For hope  is all we have  and we must never relinquish it. Even...  even to our dying breath.
Katara::  Well,  that's just silly. I don't sound like that.
Toph::  Oh man, this writer's a genius.
Actress Katara::  It appears to be someone frozen in ice. Perhaps for a hundred years.
Actor Sokka::  But who? Who is the boy in the iceberg?
Actress Katara::  Waterbend, hai-ya!
Actress Katara:: Who are you, frozen boy?
Actress &gt;Aang::  I'm the Avatar, silly. Here to spread  joy and fun.
Aang::  Wait, is that a woman playing me?
Actress Katara::  An airbender. My heart is so full of hope that it's  making me  tearbend.
Actor Sokka:: My stomach is so empty that it's making me tearbend.  I need meat.
Aang::  But wait.  Is that a platter of meaty dumplings?
Actor Sokka::  Ooo.  Where? Where?
Aang::  Did I mention  that I'm an incurable prankster?
Aang::  I don't do that. That's not what I'm like! And... I'm not a woman!
Toph::  Oh, they nailed you, Twinkle Toes.
Actor Uncle::  Prince Zuko, you must try this cake.
Actor Zuko::  I don't have time to stuff my face.  I must capture the Avatar to regain my honor!
Actor Uncle::  Well, while you do that, maybe I'll capture another slice.
Actor Zuko:: You sicken me.
Zuko::  They make me totally stiff and humorless.
Katara:: Actually, I think that actor's pretty spot on.
Zuko::  How could you say that?
Actor Uncle::  Let's forget about the Avatar and get massages.
Actor Zuko::  How could you say that?!
Actress Aang:: Hey look,  I think  I found something.  It's a flying rabbit monkey. I think  I'll name him, Momo.
Puppet Momo::  Hi, everybody.  I love you.
Actor Sokka::  Does this dress make my butt look fat?
Actor Bumi:: Riddles and challenges must you face,  if you are ever to leave this place.
Actor Sokka:: Why did you have to steal that waterbending scroll?
Actress Katara:: It just gave me so much hope!
Actor Zuko:: The Avatar is mine!  Wait, who's coming?
Actor Blue Spirit::  I am the Blue Spirit. The scourge  of the Fire Nation here to save the Avatar.
Actress Aang:: My hero.
Actor Jet:: Don't cry, baby.  Jet will wipe out that nasty town  for you.
Actress Katara::  Oh Jet, you're so bad.
Aang::  Look,  it's The Great Divide.  The biggest canyon in the Earth Kingdom.
Actor Sokka::  Meh. Let's keep flying.
Actor Sokka:: Don't go, Yue. You're  the only woman whose ever taken my mind off of food.  Wait, did you have pickled fish for dinner?
Actress Yue:: Goodbye, Sokka.  I have important Moon duties to take care of.  And yes, I did have pickled fish.
Suki::  You never  told me you made out with the Moon Spirit.
Sokka::  Shh. I'm trying to watch.
Actress Aang::  The Avatar is back to save the day! Yay!
Zuko:: So far, this intermission is the best part of the play.
Sokka::  Apparently, the playwright thinks I'm an idiot  who tells bad jokes about meat all the time.
Suki:: Yeah, you tell bad jokes  about plenty of other topics.
Sokka::  I know!
Aang::  At least this Sokka actor kinda looks like you.  That woman playing the Avatar doesn't resemble me at all.
Toph:: I don't know, you are more in touch with your feminine side than most guys.
Katara::  Relax, Aang.  They're not accurate portrayals. It's not like I'm  a preachy crybaby who can't resist giving overemotional speeches about hope all the time.  What?
Aang:: Yeah.  That's not you at all.
Toph:: Listen, friends. It's obvious that the playwright did his research. I know it must hurt but what you're seeing up there on that stage is the truth.
Actress Katara:: Well, here we are in the Earth Kingdom.
Actress Aang:: I better  have a look around to see if I can find an earthbending teacher.
Toph::  This is it! This must be where I  come in.
Actress Aang:: I flew all over town but I couldn't find a single earthbending master.
Toph::  Here it comes.
Actor Toph::  You can't find an earthbending master in the sky, you have to look underground.
Actress Aang::  Who are you?
Actor Toph::  My name is Toph because it sounds like tough.  And that's just what I am.
Toph:: Wait a minute,  I sound like...  a guy. A really buff guy.
Katara::  Well Toph, what you hear up there is the truth. It hurts, doesn't it?
Toph::  Are you kidding me?  I wouldn't have cast it any other way. At least it's not a flying bald lady.
Actress Aang:: So, you're blind?
Actor Toph::  I can see you doing that.  I see everything  that you see except that I don't like you do. I release  a sonic wave from my mouth.
Actor Toph:: There.  I got a pretty good look at you.
Actor Uncle:: Zuko, it's time we had a talk.  About your hair.  It's gone too far.
Actor Zuko:: Maybe it's best if we...  split up.
Actor Zuko:: Azula! My sister. What are you doing here?
Actress Azula::  You caught me. Wait. What's that?  I think it's your honor.
Actor Zuko::  Where?
Actress Katara::  She escaped. But how?
Actress Aang:: If she continues drilling , this wall  will come down for sure.
Actress Azula::  Haha, yes! Continue drilling.  The city  of Ba Sing Se can't hide no longer.
Actress Aang::  No, Jet!  What did they do to you?
Actor Jet:: Must.  Serve. Earth King!  Must... Destroy!
Zuko:: Did Jet just... die?
Sokka:: You know, it was really unclear.
Actress Katara:: I have to admit, Prince Zuko. I really find you attractive.
Actor Zuko:: You don't  have to make fun of me.
Actress Katara:: But I mean it.  I had eyes for you  since the day you first captured me.
Actor Zuko::  Wait.  I thought you were the Avatar's girl.
Actress Katara::  The Avatar?  Why, he's like a little brother to me.  I certainly don't think  of him in a romantic way. Besides,  how could he ever find out about this.
Sokka::  Oh, you're getting up? Can you get me some fire flakes?  Oh and  fire gummies.
Actress Azula:: Well, my brother. What's it going to be?  Your nation or a life of treachery?
Actor Uncle::  Choose treachery, it's more fun.
Actress Azula:: No way!
Actor Zuko:: I hate you,  Uncle.  You smell and I hate you for all time.
Katara:: You didn't really say that, did you?
Zuko::  I might as well have. .
Actress Aang:: Avatar State, yip yip.
Actress Azula::  Not if my lightning can't help it!
Actress Azula:: The Avatar is no more!
Suki:: It seems like every time  there's a big battle you guys barely make it out alive. I mean, you guys lose a lot.
Sokka::  You're one to talk, Suki. Didn't Azula take you captive? That's right, she did.
Suki:: Are you trying to get on my bad side?
Sokka::  I'm just saying.
Katara::  Does anyone know where Aang is?
Sokka:: He left to get me fire gummies like, 10 minutes ago.  And I'm still waiting.
Katara:: I'm going to check outside. .
Katara::  Are you alright?
Aang:: No, I'm not.  I hate this play.
Katara::  I know it's upsetting but it sounds like you're overreacting.
Aang::  Overreacting? If I hadn't blocked my chakra, I'd probably be in the Avatar State  right now.
Little Boy:: Wheeee.
Sokka:: Suki, what are the chances you can get me backstage I got some jokes I want to give to the actor >me.
Suki::  I'm an elite warrior who's trained  for many years in the art of stealth.  I think I can get you backstage.
Toph:: Jeez. Everyone's getting so upset about their characters. Even you seem more down than usual and that's saying something.
Zuko:: You don't get it.  It's different for you. You get a muscley version of yourself taking down 10 bad guys at once and making sassy remarks.
Toph:: Yeah, that's pretty great.
Zuko::  But for me, it takes all the mistakes I've made in my life and shove them back in my face.  My Uncle. He's always been on my side even when things were bad. He was there for me. He taught me so much and how do I repay him?  With a knife in his back. It's my greatest regret  and I may never get to redeem myself.
Toph::  You have redeemed yourself to your Uncle.  You don't realize it but you already have.
Zuko:: How do you know?
Toph:: Because I once had a long conversation with the guy and all he would talk about was you.
Zuko:: Really?
Toph:: Yeah, and it was kind of annoying.
Zuko:: Oh, sorry.
Toph:: But it was also very sweet.  All your Uncle wanted was for you to find your own path and see the light. Now you're here with us.  He'd be proud.
Zuko:: Ow.  What was that for?
Toph::  That's how I show affection.
Little Boy:: Your Zuko costume is pretty good but your scar's  on the wrong side.
Zuko:: The scar  is not on the wrong side!
Suki::  He's coming this way.
Actor Sokka:: Can I help you?
Sokka::  Actually, I think I can help you.  I'm a big Sokka fan but I don't think you're representing him quite as well as you could be.
Actor Sokka:: Oh no...  another fan  with ideas.
Sokka::  Just hear me out. Here's something  I think the real Sokka would say.  "What does the cabbage merchant use to fix his cabbages?"  "A cabbage patch."
Actor Sokka::  That's actually pretty good.  Let me see those.  Haha. Rocky relationship. Not bad.
Sokka::  Also, don't be afraid to make up some phrases.  Especially before an attack. Something like "Flying Kick-A-Pow!"
Actor Sokka::  Who are you, anyway?
Sokka:: I'm just a guy who likes comedy.
Aang::  Katara,  did you really mean what you said in there?
Katara::  In where? What are you talking about?
Aang::  On stage. When you said  I was just like a brother  to you and you didn't have feelings for me.
Katara::  I didn't say that. An actor  said that.
Aang:: But it's true, isn't it?  We kissed at the invasion and I thought we were going to be together but we're not.
Katara::  Aang,  I don't know.
Aang:: Why don't you know?
Katara::  Because we're in the middle of a war and  we have other things to worry about. This isn't the right time.
Aang::  Well, when is the right time?
Katara::  Aang, I'm sorry but right now,  I'm just a little confused.
Katara::  I just said that I was confused.  I'm going inside.
Aang::  Argh!  I'm such an idiot!
Sokka::  Here's what you missed.  We went to the Fire Nation and you got better and Katara was the Painted Lady  and I got a sword and I think Combustion Man died.  Ooo look, The Invasion's  about to start. Shh.
Actress Katara:: I just want to let you know Aang, that I'll always love you.  Like a brother.
Actress Aang:: I wouldn't want it  any other way.
Actor Sokka:: Hey Toph, would you say you and Aang have a rocky relationship?
Sokka::  I told him to say that.
Actor Sokka:: I hope everyone's ready for The Invasion.  Slop-A-Pow!
Actress Aang:: We finally made it to the royal palace but no one's home.
Actor Zuko:: Actually,  I'm home and  I want to join you.
Actor Sokka::  I guess  we have no choice. Come on.
Sokka:: I guess that's it.  The play's caught up to the present now.
Suki:: Wait.  The play's not over.
Sokka:: But it is over.  Unless...  This is the future.
Actor Ozai:: With the energy harnessed  from that comet, no one will be able to stop the Fire Nation!
Actress Azula::  Father, Zuko and the Avatar are at the palace. They're  trying to stop you.
Actor Ozai::  You take care of Zuko.  I shall face the Avatar myself.
Actor Zuko:: Aang, you fight the Fire Lord, I'll hold her off.
Actress Azula::  You are no longer my brother.  You are an enemy.
Actor Zuko::  I am the rightful heir to the throne!
Actress Azula::  We'll see.
Actor Zuko::  Honor!
Actor Ozai::  So,  you have mastered all 4 elements
Aang::  Yeah and now,  you're going down.
Actor Ozai::  No, it is who are going down.  You see, you are too late.  The comet is already here and  I'm unstoppable.
Actress Aang::  Nooo... .
Actress Azula:: It is over, Father.  We've done it.
Actor Ozai::  Yes, we have done it!  The dreams of my Father,  and my Father's Father have now been realized.  The World  is mine.
Zuko:: That... wasn't a good play.
Aang:: I'll say.
Katara:: No kidding.
Suki:: Horrible.
Toph:: You said it.
Sokka:: But the effects  were decent.
