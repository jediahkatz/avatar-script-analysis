Toph::  No, stop sinking!
Toph:: Don't make me put this down!
Gashuin:: Put a muzzle on him!
Toph:: I'm sorry Appa.
Gashuin::  Ransack his saddle. Who knows what treasures are stashed in there?
Gashuin:: He's tied up good, he can't hurt you.
Sandbender::  What's your father going to do when he finds out we lost a sand sailor?
Gashuin:: Nothing.  It's the one we stole from the Hammi tribe.  Did you empty the saddle?  That's it! Nothing but garbage!  Ahh! It doesn't matter. We'll still make a profit from selling him to those beetle-headed merchants!
First Beetle Merchant:: How's his temper?
Gashuin:: Uhhhh, pretty good.
Gashuin::  Uh, most of the time.
Second Beetle Merchant::  I bet someone will pay a fortune for him in Ba Sing Se.
First Beetle Merchant:: All right. You've got a deal.
Aang::  Appa! Appa!
Gashuin::   He's your problem now. Ha ha ha!
Second Beetle Merchant:: What!?
First Beetle Merchant::   We need the shirshu spit darts!
Second Beetle Merchant::  Got'em! Ok big fella, you're gonna take a nice little snoozle.
Aang::   Appa!  No... NOOOO!
First Beetle Merchant:: We've gotta get rid of this one! He's too much trouble.
Second Beetle Merchant:: We could sell him for parts.
Circus Trainer::  Oh. I understand you've had a rather hard time lately. That's too bad. You probably felt you had no choice but to behave outrageously. Like a wild animal.  But don't worry, you won't anymore.   Because I am going to break you. (From above, we see that Appa is enclosed in a circus wagon, and a number of other creatures lie in cages nearby. From the outside, pennants wave in the wind on the enormous red tent of the Fire nation circus. Returning to the inside of the animal tent, we see the Trainer pushing a cart of cabbages past a reclining platypus-bear. He tosses one of the cabbages back to the bear, who catches it in his bill and munches on it. He pushes it past Appa's cage, and the bison rises slowly, his attention on the cart. As he gains his feet, he finds that he has been chained and manacled. Rumbling with displeasure, he begins gnawing at the manacle on his forepaw. The Trainer walks past to the cage containing a vulture-griffon, who cries out in anticipation. As he feeds the beast, he turns to address Appa, who is watching him and drooling.
Circus Trainers:: Hungry? Don't worry, I'm going to feed you too.  But not yet. First I am going to show you how you'll earn it.
Circus Trainer:: Or course, when you perform, the hoops will be flaming.  And if you are careful, you won't get burned.
Circus Trainer::  You're about to be sorry.
Circus Trainer:: It's obvious that whoever your previous owner was, he had no idea how to handle you properly.
Fire Nation Man:: I am gonna get a bag of sizzle-crisps.  Stay here and stay away from that monster. Behave yourself, or you'll regret it.
Circus Trainer::  He's a difficult creature, stubborn and willful. I need more time with him. It's too risky right now.
Ring Master::  Too Risky? What are you talking about?  This is the circus, home of fear and danger. I want the Wind Buffalo to perform tonight .
Circus Trainer::  If you don't behave yourself, you'll regret it.
Fire Nation Man:: Let's go!
Fire Nation Boy::  See ya later buddy.
Ring Master::  Ladies and gentleman, now for something truly special.  A noble beast so magnificent and rare, it hasn't been seen by human eyes in generations.  I give you the Wind Buffalo!
Circus Trainer:: Up.
Circus Trainer::  Up, you insolent cow!
Fire Nation Boy::  Run away! Get away from him.
Circus Trainer:: Augh! Oof.
Fire Nation Boy:: Go. You can do it.
Circus Trainer::  Get back here, you stupid beast!
Air Nomad Woman:: Chose well. A sky bison is a companion for life.
Aang::   Ugh! I guess this mean we'll always be together.
Aang::  Always.
Farmer:: AAhhh! It's some kind of monster!
Iroh:: Huh!
Zuko::  Uncle? What are you looking at? Is there something out there?
Iroh::  Uh, it's nothing. Go back to sleep.
Kyoshi Warrior::  Must have been some fight.
Suki:: Wait. Let me see that.  No. It couldn't be.
Suki:: Huh? Appa? Oh no.
Suki::  It's gonna be ok Appa. I have to leave, but I am gonna be back soon with help.
Suki::  No sudden movements. He's been lost for awhile, and he looks like he's hurt. He's shy around people and scared. Stay low, and stay quiet.
Kyoshi Warrior:: I can't believe you found the Avatar's bison. Didn't you just see the Avatar a few days ago?
Suki:: Yes, so he can't be too far from here. It's our responsibility to get Appa back to him safely. This could be our most important mission yet.
Suki:: Give him some space!  Appa, it's me, Suki. I'm a friend.  I want to help you. You're hurt. We can help you feel better. And we can help you find Aang.
Azula::  My, my, you're easy to find.  It's really astounding my brother hasn't captured you yet.
Suki:: What do you want with us?
Azula::  Who are you, the Avatar's fan girls?
Ty Lee::   Oh, I get it! I get it. Good one, Azula!
Suki:: If you are looking for the Avatar, you're out of luck.
Mai::  I knew this was a waste of time.
Azula:: No Avatar huh?  Well that's ok, any friend of the Avatar, is an enemy of mine.
Mai:: You're so colorful, it's making me nauseous.
Ty Lee::  You're not prettier than we are!
Azula:: Afraid of fire I see. That's good, you should be!
Suki::  Go Appa! Fly away from here! Get out of here.
Suki::  Get out of here! You have to find Aang! We'll be ok!
Azula::  Don't you know that fans just make flames stronger?
Guru:: Hello. I am Guru Pathik.
Guru::  I know I am not the person you expected. And I didn't expect to be licked by a giant tongue just now. The world is full of surprises.
Guru:: Oh, dear. You've been through so much recently. Hurt and betrayed, so twisted up inside.  You're still full of love.  But fear has moved in where trust should be.  I've been expecting you and the young Avatar for quite a long time. I had a vision many years ago of helping him. That's why I came to the Eastern Air Temple  Ahh. Your emotions are so turbulent. Like swirling storm clouds..   Let the clouds in your mind be gentle, peaceful ones.
Guru:: Someone looks very well-rested, judging by your bed head.
Guru:: I have prepared a message for Aang. May I attach it to your horn?   You and the Avatar's energies are mixed. You have an unbreakable bond. By reading your energy,  I can sense where Aang is.  Funny, what invisible strings connect us all. .
Guru::  I will see you again, great beast.
