Katara:: This should give us a good idea of what's around here.
Aang:: I bet we'll find something to eat here! . The Fire Days Festival.  Fire Nation cultural exhibits...jugglers, benders, magicians. This'd be a great place for me to study some real firebenders!
Aang:: Hey, a poster of me!
Sokka:: A wanted poster. This is bad.
Katara:: I think we better keep moving.
Aang:: I have to learn firebending at some point, and this could be my only chance to watch a master up close.
Sokka:: What!? You want to walk into a Fire Nation town where they're all fired up with all their, you know, fire?
Katara:: We'll wear disguises and if it looks like trouble, we'll leave.
Aang:: You guys stay out of sight here while we go to the festival.
Aang:: Ready disguises!
Aang:: Let's go.
Katara:: I think we need some new disguises.
Mask Merchant:: Get your genu-ine Fire Festival masks here!
Food Merchant:: Flaming fire flakes! Best in town.
Sokka:: I'll take'em!
Sokka:: Aaahhh! Hot! Hot!
Puppet Fire Lord:: Don't worry loyal citizens! No one can surprise the Fire Lord!
Katara:: Aang, hold on! Where are we going?
Aang:: I don't know, but there's a big crowd so it must be good.
Sokka:: Knowing the Fire Nation, it's probably an execution.
Aang:: I gotta learn that trick!
Sokka:: What do you think you're doing?
Aang:: I want to get a closer look.
Katara:: It's better that we don't attract any attention to ourselves.
Performer:: Awww, she's shy. Leeet's give her some encouragement, folks!
Aang:: Awww! That could'a been me.
Performer:: This next trick is called "Taming the Dragon."  You will be my captured princess!
Performer:: Don't worry, young maiden! I will tame this fiery beast!  It's too strong, I can't hold it!
Aang:: We gotta help her!
Sokka:: No, we don't want to make a scene!
Performer:: The rope, it's breaking!
Audience Member:: Hey! That kid's the Avatar!
Sokka:: I think it's time to go.
Guard:: There they are!
Aang:: I'm calling Appa!
Sokka:: I hope he can really hear that bison whistle!
Aang:: Appa! Down here!
Aang:: Nice touch setting off the fireworks.
Sokka:: You seem to really know your explosives.
Chey:: Was. My name's Chey.
Chey:: I serve a man. More than a man really, he's a myth, but he's real, a living legend, Jeong Jeong the Deserter. He was a Fire Nation general, or wait, was he an admiral?
Sokka:: He was very highly ranked, we get it.
Chey:: Yeh! Way up there! But he couldn't take the madness any more. He's the first person ever to leave the army - and live. I'm the second, but you don't get to be a legend for that. That's okay though. Jeong Jeong's a firebending genius. Some say he's mad - but he's not! He's enlightened.
Aang:: You mean there's a firebender out here who's not with the Fire Lord?  We've gotta go see him! He can train me!
Sokka:: We're not gonna go find some crazy firebender!
Sokka:: That's what you said about going to the festival! Why doesn't anyone ever listen to me!?
Lin Yi:: Don't move!
Lin Yi:: Jeong Jeong told you not to look for Avatar!
Sokka:: Hold on, you know these guys!?
Chey:: Oh yeh! Lin Yi's an old buddy! Right Lin Yi?
Lin Yi:: Go on. He sees you only.
Chey:: Oh that's okay, we can chat later.
Aang:: Is that where Jeong Jeong is? I need to talk to him right away.
Lin Yi:: No! You wait there.  Go now!
Chey:: Don't worry! Everything'll be fine. He's a great man, great man!
Zhao:: So, the Avatar was here and you let slip away?
Officer:: Yes, sir, but other than that the festival went off without a hitch!  No fights. Theft was way down.
Zhao:: I don't care about your local crime rates! Which way did they go?
Aang:: What happened? Can I see Jeong Jeong now?
Aang:: Why won't he see me?
Chey:: He says you're not ready. Says you haven't mastered waterbending and earthbending yet.
Aang:: Wait, how does he know that?
Chey:: He saw the way you walked into camp. He can tell.
Aang:: I'm going in anyway!
Jeong Jeong:: Get out.
Aang:: Master, I need to learn firebending.
Jeong Jeong:: Only a fool seeks his own destruction.
Jeong Jeong:: Destiny? What would a boy know of destiny? If a fish lives its whole life in this river, does he know the river's destiny? No! Only that it runs on and on out of his control! He may follow where it flows, but he cannot see the end. He cannot imagine the ocean.
Aang:: Ookay, but it's the Avatar's duty to master all of the bending disciplines.
Jeong Jeong:: To master the bending disciplines, you must first master discipline itself. But you have no interest in this, so I have no interest in you! Now, get out.
Aang:: Please, I have to learn. This could be my only chance.
Avatar Roku:: You think I am weak?
Jeong Jeong:: Avatar Roku! No! No!  I did not mean that!
Avatar Roku:: I have mastered the elements a thousand times in a thousand lifetimes. Now, I must do it once again. You will teach the Avatar firebending.
Aang:: Really? That's great!
Jeong Jeong:: Widen your stance.  Wider! Bend your knees. Now, concentrate.  Good, good!
Aang:: But what am I concentrating on?
Jeong Jeong:: Feel the heat of the sun. It is the greatest source of fire. Yet, it is in complete balance with nature!
Jeong Jeong:: Concentrate!
Aang:: Are we coming up here so I don't burn anything with my fire blasts?
Jeong Jeong:: No fire yet.
Jeong Jeong:: Power in firebending comes from the breath. That is why you must master proper breath control.
Aang:: You brought me up here to breathe?
Jeong Jeong:: Assume your stance.
Jeong Jeong:: Wider.
Aang:: You're not even look...
Jeong Jeong:: Wider! Now, inhale through the nose and exhale through the mouth - without talking.  Good. Keep going.
Aang:: I've been breathing for hours.
Jeong Jeong:: You want to stop breathing?
Jeong Jeong:: Learn restraint, or risk destroying yourself and everything you love.
Aang:: I thought about what you said. I promise I'll be more patient.
Jeong Jeong:: We're going to work with fire now.
Aang:: Oh yeh!
Aang:: I mean, let us begin.
Jeong Jeong:: Concentrate on the fire. I want you to keep this flame from reaching the edges of the leaf for as long as you can.
Rebel:: Master! There is trouble.
Aang:: What's going on?
Katara:: I'm sure there's a good reason.
Aang:: But I'm ready to do so much more.
Aang:: I did it! I made fire!
Katara:: Careful!
Aang:: Now that's firebending!
Katara:: Aang, you'll hurt yourself!
Aang:: Katara!  I'm so sorry!
Aang:: Iiiit was an accident! I was... Katara, I'm so -
Sokka:: I told you we shouldn't mess around with this! Look what you did! You burned my sister!
Sokka:: You burned my sister!  This is all your fault!
Jeong Jeong:: I know. Now pack your things. You must leave immediately.
Aang:: I'm sorry, I didn't...  I'm sorry!
Katara:: But you're a great master. You have powers I'll never know.
Jeong Jeong:: Water brings healing and life. But fire brings only destruction and pain. It forces those of us burdened with its care to walk a razor's edge between humanity and savagery. Eventually, we are torn apart.
Jeong Jeong:: Go get your friends and flee!  Do not come back here or you will all be destroyed. Hurry!
Zhao:: Don't worry, men. My old teacher gave up fighting a long time ago.
Zhao:: Master Jeong Jeong.
Sokka:: Katara! Are you all right?
Katara:: I'm fine, we've got to get out of here. Where's Aang?
Aang:: Jeong Jeong tried to tell me that I wasn't ready. I wouldn't listen. I'm never going to firebend again.
Katara:: You'll have to eventually.
Aang:: No, never again.
Katara:: It's okay, Aang. I'm healed.
Aang:: What? How?
Katara:: I'll explain later. But right now, we have to get out here. Zhao and his soldiers are attacking!
Katara:: By the river. They captured Jeong Jeong.
Zhao:: Look at you. You were once so great. I can't believe my former master has become nothing more than a simple savage.
Jeong Jeong:: It is you who have embraced savagery, Zhao.
Zhao:: It's Admiral Zhao, now.
Jeong Jeong:: That title will not help you against the Avatar. Do not try to fight him! You are no match!
Jeong Jeong:: I have never seen such raw power.
Zhao:: We'll see. Men! Take the deserter!
Aang:: YOU were Jeong Jeong's student?
Zhao:: Until I got bored.
Zhao:: I see he taught you how to duck and run like a coward. But I doubt he showed you what a firebender is truly capable of!
Aang:: Whoa! Wild shot!
Zhao:: I'll show you wild!
Zhao:: Stand and fight, Avatar!
Aang:: Oh, were we fighting? I thought you were just getting warmed up.
Zhao:: I was!
Aang:: Is that all you got? Man, they'll make anyone an admiral these days!
Aang:: Ahoy!  I'm Admiral Zhao!
Aang:: I don't know why, but I thought you'd be better than Zuko.
Aang:: Sloppy. Very sloppy.
Zhao:: No wonder to run now, you little smart mouth!
Aang:: You've lost this battle.
Zhao:: Are you crazy? You haven't thrown a single blow!
Aang:: Jeong Jeong said you had no restraint.
Aang:: Have a nice walk home!
Aang:: Wait! Where's Jeong Jeong?
Sokka:: He disappeared. They all did.
Chey:: Hey, where did everybody go? Very funny guys!
Katara:: Aang, you're burned.
Katara:: Let me help you.
Aang:: Wow! That's good water.
Sokka:: When did you learn how to do that?
Sokka:: Oh... well then thanks for all the first aid over the years. Like when I fell into the grease briar bramble and that time I had two fish hooks in my thumb!
Aang:: Two?
Katara:: He tried to get the first fish hook out with another fish hook.
Sokka:: Oh, and the time that big snake bit me! Thanks for healing that up. That was great. Really helpful.
