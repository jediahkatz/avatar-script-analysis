Sokka:: Hey, I remember her. She helped you attack us!
Zuko:: Yup, back in the good old days.
June:: Oh great,  it's Prince Pouty. Where's your creepy grandpa?
Zuko:: He's my Uncle, and he's not here.
June::  I see you worked things out with your girlfriend.
Katara:: I'm not his girlfriend!
Zuko:: She's not my girlfriend!
June:: Okay, okay,  sheesh. I was only teasing. So what you want?
Zuko:: I need your help finding the Avatar.
June:: Hmph. Doesn't sound too fun.
Zuko::  Does the end of the World  sound like more fun?
June::  Nyla...  Who's my little snuffly wuffly.  Whoa!  Careful there. Okay,  whose got something with the Avatar's scent on it.
Katara:: I have Aang's staff.
Zuko::  Well, what does that mean?
June:: It means your friend's gone.
Toph:: We know he's gone, that's why we're trying to find him.
June::  No, I mean he's gone gone .  He doesn't exist.
Aang:: Where are we, Momo?  Maybe I'm in the Spirit World  But wait,  you can see me. We can both  be in the Spirit World.  Nope,  my bending works.  Maybe if we climb  to the top of the island we could figure out where we are.
Sokka:: What do you mean Aang doesn't exist?  Do you mean he's... you know, dead?
June::  Nope, we could find him if he were dead. Ah,  it's a real head scratcher.  See ya.
Toph:: Helpful, real helpful.
Zuko:: Wait,  I have another idea.  There's only one other person in this World who can help us face the Fire Lord.  I'll be right back with a smell sample.
Sokka:: You saved your Uncle's sweaty sandal?
Toph:: I think it's kind of sweet.
June:: Let's do this.
Zuko:: Hey, wait up!
Zuko:: We're going to Ba Sing Se?
June::  Your Uncle's somewhere beyond the wall.  Nyla's getting twitchy so he can't be too far. Good luck.
Zuko:: It's been a long day.  Let's camp and start our search again at dawn.
Aang:: It's a hexagon.  It doesn't  seem raises his arms in exasperation and walks away like normal rock.  It's not made of earth. This is so strange.  I wish I had some help right now. I wish I had Roku. I do have Roku.
Avatar Roku:: You're right, Aang.  All the past Avatars, all their experience and wisdom,  is available to you  if you look deep inside yourself.
Aang::  So where am I, Roku? What is this place?
Avatar Roku::  I... don't know, Aang.  But  I see that you are lost in more ways than one right now.
Aang:: I am.  I need to figure out what to do once I face the Fire Lord.
Bumi:: Well, look who's  here.
Aang:: Everyone expects me to take the Fire Lord's life but I just don't know if I can do that.
Avatar Roku::  In my life, I tried to be disciplined and show restraint. But it backfired when  Fire Lord Sozin took advantage of my restraint and mercy. If I had been more decisive  and acted sooner, I could have stopped Sozin  and stop the war  before it started.  I offer you this wisdom, Aang.  You must be decisive.
Toph:: What's going on?  We're surrounded by old people.
Katara:: Not just any  old people. These  are great masters and friends of ours.  Pakku.
Pakku::  It is respectful to bow to an old master but how about a hug  for your new grandfather?
Katara:: That's so exciting.  You and Gran Gran must be so happy to have found each other again.
Pakku:: I made her a  new betrothal necklace and everything.
Sokka:: Welcome to the family Great Gramp.
Pakku:: You can still just call me  Pakku.
Sokka::  How about Grand Pakku?
Pakku::  No.
Katara:: And this was  Aang's first firebending teacher.
Jeong Jeong:: Jeong Jeong.
Sokka:: Master Piandao.
Piandao::  Hello, Sokka.
Suki:: So wait, how do you all know each other?
Bumi::  All old people know  each other don't you know that?
Piandao:: We're all part of the same ancient secret society. A group that transcends the divisions of the 4 nations.
Zuko::  The Order of the White Lotus.
Bumi:: That's the one.
Jeong Jeong:: The White Lotus has always been about philosophy, and beauty and truth.  About a month ago, a call went out that we were needed for something important.
Pakku::  It came from a Grand Lotus, your Uncle,  Iroh of the Fire Nation.
Toph:: Well that's who we're looking for.
Piandao::  Then we'll take you to him.
Bumi::  Wait, someone's  missing from your group. Someone  very important. Where's  Momo?
Sokka:: He's gone. And so is Aang.
Bumi:: Oh well, so long as they have each other I'm sure  we have nothing  to worry about. Let's go.
Aang:: Avatar Kyoshi, I need your wisdom.
Avatar Kyoshi:: In my day,  Chin the Conqueror threatened to throw the World out of balance.  I stopped him and the World entered a great era of peace.
Aang::  But you didn't really kill Chin,  technically he fell to his own doom because  he was too stubborn to get out of the way.
Avatar Kyoshi::  Personally I don't really see the difference but I assure you, I would have done whatever it took to stop Chin.  I offer you this wisdom, Aang.  Only justice will bring peace.
Aang:: I knew I shouldn't have asked Kyoshi.
Sokka:: So Bumi,  how did you end up escaping your imprisonment in Omashu?
Bumi:: Escape? I didn't escape, everybody else escaped.  There I was,  back in Omashu, waiting for just the right  moment. I didn't know  what or when but I knew I'd know it when I knew it.  An eclipse. That would do it.
Fire Nation soldier:: What do you  think you're doing?
Bumi:: Taking back my city. You've got no  fire power and it's payback time.
Suki:: Wow, you took back your whole city all by yourself.
Bumi:: So what about you guys? Did you do anything interesting on the day of the eclipse?
Zuko:: Nah.
Sokka:: No, not really.
Aang:: I need to look deep inside myself.
Avatar Kuruk::  I am Avatar Kuruk. When I was young,  I was always  a "go with the flow" kind of Avatar. People seemed to work out their own problems  and there was peace and  good times in the World.  But then,  I lost the woman I loved to Koh,  the face stealer.  It was my fault, if I had been more attentive and more active, I could have saved her. Aang, you must actively shape your own destiny, and  the destiny of the World.
Bumi:: Well, here we are.  Welcome to old people camp.
Zuko:: Where... where is he?
Piandao:: Your Uncle's in  there,  Prince Zuko.
Katara:: Are you okay?
Zuko:: No,  I'm not okay. My Uncle hates me, I know it.  He loved me and supported me in every way he could and I still turned against him. How can I even face him?
Katara::  Zuko, you're sorry for what you did, right?
Zuko:: More sorry than I've been about anything in my entire life.
Katara::  Then he'll forgive you.  He will.
Zuko:: Uncle.
Aang::  All these past Avatars,  they keep telling me I'm gonna have to do it. They don't get it.  You're right, maybe an air nomad Avatar would understand where I'm coming from.  I know you can't really talk. Pretending you can just helps me think.  I'm going to pretend I didn't pretend to hear that.
Avatar Yangchen:: I am Avatar Yangchen,  young airbender.
Aang::  Avatar Yangchen, the monks always  taught me that all life is sacred. Even the life of the tiniest spider-fly caught in its own web.
Avatar Yangchen::  Yes, all life is sacred.
Aang::   I know, I'm  even a vegetarian. I've always tried to solve my problems by being quick or clever and I've only had to use violence for necessary defence and I've certainly  never used it to take a life.
Avatar Yangchen::  Avatar Aang,  I know that you're a gentle spirit and the monks have taught you well. But this isn't about you,  this is about the World.
Aang:: But the monks taught me that I had to detach myself from the World so my spirit could be free.
Avatar Yangchen::  Many great and wise air nomads have detached themselves and achieved spiritual enlightenment but the Avatar  can never do it because your sole duty is to the World. Here is my wisdom for you,  selfless duty  calls you to sacrifice your own spiritual needs and do whatever  it takes to protect the World.
Aang::  I guess I don't have a choice, Momo.  I have to kill the Fire Lord.
Zuko:: Uncle, I know you must have mixed feelings about seeing me.  But I want  you to know, I'm so  so sorry, Uncle.  I'm so sorry and ashamed of what I did.  I don't know  how I can ever make it up to you but  I'll...
Zuko::  How can you forgive me so easily? I thought you would be furious with me.
Iroh:: I was never angry with you. I was sad  because I was afraid you lost your way.
Zuko::  I did lose my way.
Iroh:: But you found it again.  And you did it by yourself. And  I am so happy you found your way here.
Zuko:: It wasn't that hard, Uncle.  You have a pretty strong scent.
Aang:: Wait,  is it just me or are those mountains getting bigger?
Aang:: They're not getting larger, they're getting closer.  The whole island is moving!
Aang::  It's amazing, Momo!  The biggest animal in the World!  I've got to swim around and find its face.
Zuko::  Uncle, you're the only person other than the Avatar  who can possibly defeat the Father Lord.
Toph::  You mean the Fire Lord.
Zuko:: That's what I just said.
Iroh:: Hmm...
Zuko:: We need you to come with us.
Iroh::  No, Zuko. It won't turn out well.
Zuko:: You can beat him and we'll  be there to help.
Iroh::  Even if I did defeat Ozai, and I don't know that  I could. It will be the wrong way to end the war.  History would see it as just more senseless violence,  a brother killing a brother to grab power. The only way for this war to end peacefully is for the Avatar to defeat the Fire Lord.
Zuko::  And then... then would you come and take your rightful place on the throne?
Iroh::  No. Someone  new must take the throne. An idealist with a pure heart and  unquestionable honour. It has to be you,  Prince Zuko.
Zuko::  Unquestionable honour? But I've made  so many mistakes.
Iroh::  Yes, you have.  You struggled, you suffered but you have always followed your own path, you  restored your own honour. And only you  can restore the honour of the Fire Nation.
Zuko:: I'll try, Uncle.
Toph::  Well,  what if Aang doesn't come back?
Iroh:: Sozin's Comet is arriving and our destinies are upon us. Aang will face the Fire Lord.  When I was a boy, I had a vision that I would one day take Ba Sing Se.  Only now do I see that my destiny is to take it back from the Fire Nation so the Earth Kingdom can be free again.
Suki::  That's why you gathered  the members of the White Lotus.
Iroh:: Yes.  Zuko,  you must return to the Fire Nation so that when the Fire Lord falls, you can assume the throne and restore peace and order.  But Azula will be there, waiting  for you.
Zuko::  I can handle Azula.
Iroh::  Not alone.  You'll need help.
Zuko:: You're right.  Katara,  how would you like to help me put Azula in her place?
Katara::  It would be my pleasure.
Sokka::  What  about us?  What's  our destiny today?
Iroh::  What do you think it is?
Sokka::  I think that... even though we don't know where Aang is, we need to do  everything we can to stop the airship fleet.
Toph:: And that means when Aang does face the Fire Lord, we'll be right there if he needs us.
Piandao:: Nothing runs faster over land or swims quicker than a giant eel-hound.  The airship base is on a small island just off the EarthKingdom shore.  You should be able  to intercept the fleet within a day's journey.
Sokka:: Thank you, Master.
Zuko:: So if I'm going to be Fire Lord after the war is over, what are you going to do?
Iroh::  After I re-conquer Ba Sing Se,  I'm going to re-conquer  my tea shop and I'm going  to play Pai Sho  everyday.
Katara::  Goodbye, General Iroh.
Iroh:: Goodbye, everyone.  Today,  destiny is our friend.  I know it.
Aang:: A lion turtle.  Maybe you can  help me. Everyone,  even my own past lives are expecting me to end someone's life. But I don't know if I can do it.
Lion Turtle::  The true mind can weather all the lies and illusions without being lost. The true heart  can touch the poison of hatred without being harmed.  Since beginningless time,  darkness thrives in the void,  but always yields to purifying light.
Lion Turtle:: Wait for him, he will come.
Ozai:: It's time for this World to end in fire and for a new World  to be born from the ashes.
