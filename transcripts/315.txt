Guard:: Line them up for the Warden!
Sokka:: Dad.  Excuse me, coming through. The Warden wants me over there  sorry.
Warden:: Welcome to The Boiling Rock. I'm sure  you've all heard the horrible rumors about our little island. Well I just want to tell you that they don't have to be true. As long as you  do everything I say. Look me  in the eye when I'm talking to you.
Hakoda::  No.
Warden::  Oh, you'd rather look at my shoes? Then take a look!
Warden:: I know exactly who you are, Hakoda of the Water Tribe. So strong willed. But don't worry,  we'll get rid of that in time. Now look me in the eye.
Warden:: See? Isn't that better. You will  all do as I say or pay the price.  You will all...
Guard:: Are you okay, Sir?
Warden::  I'm fine! Get these prisoners out of my sight!
Sokka:: Thank goodness you're okay.
Hakoda::  If you take one step closer you'll  see just how okay I am.
Sokka::  Dad, it's me.
Hakoda::  Sokka, my son.
Hakoda:: You know Sokka, you should be more careful with that guard outfit on. I almost punched you in the gut.
Sokka:: Yeah,  I ran into that problem earlier.
Warden:: Are you comfortable Chit Sang?
Chit Sang::  If you're trying to get me to talk, forget it. I'm not a squealer.
Warden::  Chit Sang, I only asked you if you were comfortable.
Chit Sang:: Well, yeah.  Actually, I am pretty comfortable.
Warden:: Are you still comfortable?
Chit Sang::  No.
Warden:: I know you and your cronies are not smart enough to come up with that little escape plan.  So you're gonna tell me. Who is?
Sokka:: So where's Bato?  Where's everyone else from the invasion?
Hakoda::  The others are being held at a prison near the Fire Nation palace. They singled me out as their leader and sent me here.  But before I left I met some young women who said they knew you. The Yoshinama Fighters?
Sokka:: You mean the Kyoshi Warriors?
Hakoda:: That's right.
Sokka:: Their leader Suki is here and she's gonna escape with us.
Hakoda:: Good,  we'll need all the help we can get.
Sokka:: And you know Prince Zuko?
Hakoda:: The son of the Firelord? I don't know him, but I knew of him.
Sokka:: Well, he's here too.
Hakoda::  Sounds like a major problem.
Sokka:: Actually, he's on our side now.  I know, I had the same reaction. After all he has done, it was hard to trust him. But he's really proven himself and I never would have found you without his help.
Hakoda:: So, do you have a plan?
Sokka:: We had one  but some of the other prisoners got involved and ruined it.  I don't know if there's another way off this island.
Hakoda:: Sokka,  there's no prison in the World that can hold two Water Tribe geniuses.
Sokka:: Then we'd better find two.
Sokka:: Zuko, are you there?
Zuko::  I'm here.
Sokka:: I just got done talking to my Dad. We came up with an escape plan together.
Male Guard:: What  are you doing here?
Sokka::  I was just  telling this dirty lowlife what I think of him!
Male Guard::  Well, you'll have to do that later, he's coming with us.
Sokka::  Why?
Female Guard::  Because we have orders straight from the Warden. That's why.
Sokka::  Could I just get ten more seconds to rough him up a bit?
Female Guard::  Fine, ten seconds.
Sokka::  Take that! And this!
Male &gt;Guard::  Newbie.
Sokka::  We have a new plan but it's gonna need a big distraction.  Be in the yard in one hour.
Male Guard::  Alright, that's enough.
Zuko:: What are you doing? Where are you taking me?
Zuko:: I didn't do anything wrong.
Mai::  Come on  Zuko.  We all know  that's a lie.
Zuko::  Mai.
Warden:: How is he?
Guard:: I think he's ready to talk.
Warden::  Have you had enough time to about what I asked?
Chit Sang:: Yes.
Warden:: And?
Chit Sang:: You're right. There was another person involved in the escape plan.
Warden::  Who?
Chit Sang:: It's a guy who's disguised like a prison guard, only he's not a prison guard. He's the mastermind. He came up with the plan.
Zuko:: How did you know I was here?
Mai::  Because I know you so well.
Zuko::  But... how?
Mai::  The Warden's my Uncle you idiot.  The truth is,  I guess I don't know you. All I get is a letter.  You could have at least looked me in the eye when you ripped out my heart.
Zuko::  I didn't mean to...
Mai::  You didn't mean to?  Dear Mai, I'm sorry that you have to find out this way, but I'm leaving.
Zuko::  Stop!  This isn't about you. This is about the Fire Nation.
Mai:: Thanks Zuko. That makes me feel all better.
Zuko::  Mai, I never wanted to hurt you.  But I have to do this to save my country.
Mai:: Save it? You're betraying your country.
Zuko::  That's not how I see it.
Suki:: Sokka,  what's going on?
Sokka:: I don't have much time.  If I'm seen with you  the guards might think something's up.  I just talked to my Dad.
Suki:: That's great.
Sokka:: Yeah and we're escaping today. On the gondola.
Suki::  What?
Sokka:: My dad and I came up with a plan together. We're gonna commandeer the gondola and  we're gonna take a hostage with us so they won't cut the lines.
Suki::  We'll never make it onto the gondola. There's too many guards.
Sokka:: My dad already thought of that. He said we'll need a distraction. That's why we're gonna start a prison riot.
Suki::  Okay. Let's say by some miracle this all works and we make it on the gondola. The Warden will still just cut the lines, even if we have a captive.
Sokka:: Not if the Warden the captive.  I have to go.  I'll find you before we start the riot.
Male Guard::  Hey you!  The Warden wants to see you.
Sokka::  Why?
Male Guard:: I don't know. I didn't ask.
Sokka:: Maybe I could schedule another time with him? How's tomorrow?
Male Guard:: He wants to see you,  now.
Warden:: Put him in the line up.
Warden:: One of you is an imposter who thought  he could fool me. But now that person  is going to be in a lot of trouble. Who is it?
Chit Sang::  That's him,  Warden.  He's the imposter.
Bully Guard::  What?  I am not. He's lying!  He's a liar!
Bully Guard:: I'm telling you, it wasn't me.
Warden:: Save your breath. I know you've been working together.  You threw Chit Sang in the very cooler they used to escape. It was all part of your plan.
Bully Guard:: That was just a coincidence.
Guard::  Sir, there's someone to see you.
Warden::  Who told you to interrupt me!
Azula:: I did.
Warden::  Princess Azula. Uh, it is an honor  to welcome you to the Fire Nation's most exemplary prison. I didn't realize  you were coming.
Azula::  Who is this?
Warden::  He's a guard who was involved in a recent and feeble escape attempt.
Bully Guard:: It wasn't me.
Warden:: Quiet you.
Azula:: You're wasting your time.  That's not one of them.
Warden::  How do you know?
Azula::  Because I'm a people person.
Sokka::  Hey, I just got orders. Let the prisoners out into the yard.
Guard::  But we're in the middle of lockdown.
Sokka:: Oh, okay.  I'll just go tell the Warden you said that. I'm sure  he'll be to hear about you undermining his authority.  What's your name again?
Guard::  Wait. Don't tell the Warden, I... I'm just a little confused.
Sokka::  Hey, I'm confused too.  But the Warden's in a bad mood and irrational. So if you ask me,  it's best not to question it and just do what he says.
Guard:: Yeah, you're right.  We're letting them out.
Sokka:: This is it. We have to start a riot.
Suki:: Okay, but how do we do that?
Hakoda:: I'll show you.
Prisoner:: Hey, why did you do that for? That hurt my feelings.
Hakoda::  Aren't you mad at me?
Prisoner:: Uhh, well normally I would be, but I've been working to control my anger.
Sokka:: This isn't working.
Chit Sang:: Hey you.  You're lucky I didn't rat you out. But my generosity comes with a price. I know you're planning another escape attempt and I want in.
Sokka:: Actually, we're trying to escape right now. But we need a riot.  You wouldn't happen to know how to start one would you?
Chit Sang:: A prison riot?  Please.  Hey!  Riot!
Hakoda::  Impressive.
Prisoner:: Forget about controlling my anger. Let's riot!
Warden:: Who let these prisoners into the yard? This is supposed to be a lockdown!
Guard:: Ma'am, there's a riot going on. I'm here to protect you.
Mai::  I don't need any protection.
Zuko::  Hah, believe me. She doesn't.
Guard::  I'm sorry but I'm under direct orders  from your Uncle to make sure nothing happens.
Mai:: Get off of me!
Sokka:: Zuko, good. We're all here. Now all we need to do  is grab the Warden and get to the gondolas.
Zuko:: And how do we do that?
Sokka::  I'm not sure.
Zuko:: Argh, I thought you thought this through.
Sokka::  I thought you told me it's okay not to think everything through!
Zuko::  Maybe not everything. But this is kind of important.
Chit Sang:: Hey, uhh, fellas. I think your girlfriend's taking care of it.
Warden:: You wouldn't dare.
Suki:: Sorry Warden,  you're my prisoner now.
Suki:: We've got the Warden, now let's get out of here.
Hakoda::  That's some girl.
Sokka::  Tell me about it.
Suki::  We're almost there.
Zuko:: Back off, we've got the Warden.
Zuko:: Let's go.
Suki:: Everyone in.
Sokka::  What are you doing?
Zuko:: I'm making it so they can't stop us.
Sokka:: Way to think ahead.
Suki:: We're on our way.
Hakoda:: Wait. Who's that?
Zuko::  That's a problem.  It's my sister and her friend.
Suki:: This is a rematch I've been waiting for.
Zuko:: Me too.
Guard #1::  There's the Warden. I see him!
Warden:: Cut the line!
Guard #2::  He wants us to cut the line.
Guard #3::  But if we cut the line, there's no way he'll survive.
Guard #1::  He knows that.
Ty Lee:: They're about to cut the line!
Azula::  Then it's time to leave.  Goodbye Zuko.  .
Zuko:: They're cutting the line. The gondola's about to go!
Hakoda:: I hope this thing floats.
Guard:: What are you doing?!
Mai::  Saving the jerk who dumped me.
Sokka::  Who is that? .
Zuko::  It's Mai.
Azula::  What is she doing?!
Hakoda::  Sorry Warden, your record is officially broken.
Suki:: Well, we made it out. Now what?
Sokka::  Zuko, what are you doing?
Zuko:: My sister was on that island.
Sokka:: Yeah and she's probably right behind us. So let's not stop.
Zuko:: What I mean is she must have come here somehow.  There.  That's our way out of here.
Azula::  Leave us alone.
Azula::  I never expected this from you.
Azula:: The thing I don't understand is why  Why would you do it? You know the consequences.
Mai:: I guess you just don't know people as well as you think you do. You miscalculated.  I love Zuko more than I fear you.
Azula::  No, you miscalculated! You should have feared me more!
Ty Lee:: Come on,  let's get out of here!
Azula::  You're both fools.
Guard:: What shall we do with them, princess?
Azula::  Put them somewhere  I'll never have to see their faces again.  And let them rot.
Katara:: What are you doing in this thing? What happened to the war balloon?
Zuko::  It kind of got destroyed.
Aang::  Sounds like a crazy fishing trip.
Toph:: Did you at least get some good meat?
Sokka::  I did.  The best meat of all.  The meat of friendship and fatherhood.
Chit Sang::  I'm new. What's up everybody?
Katara::  Dad.
Hakoda::  Hi, Katara.
Katara::  How are you here? What is going on?  Where did you go?
Sokka::  We... kind of went to a Fire Nation prison.
Toph::  Seriously, you guys didn't find any meat?
