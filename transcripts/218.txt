Aang:: I missed you more than you'll ever know, buddy.
Sokka:: Look, we escaped from the Dai Li, we got Appa back, I'm telling you, we should go to the Earth King now and tell him our plan. We're on a roll.
Katara:: One good hour after weeks of trouble isn't much of a roll.
Sokka:: We can build on it. If we want to invade the Fire Nation when the eclipse happens, we need the Earth King's support.
Toph:: What makes you think we'll get it? I don't know if you've noticed, but things don't usually go that smoothly for our little gang.
Sokka:: I know, but I've got a good feeling about this. This time will be different.
Katara:: Sokka, Long Feng is control of the city. His conspiracy with the Dai Li is too powerful. I think we should just keep flying and leave this horrible place behind us.
Toph:: I'm with sweetness. I've seen enough of Ba Sing Se, and I can't even see!
Aang:: But now that we have Appa back, there is nothing stopping us from telling the Earth King the truth about the conspiracy and the war.
Sokka:: See, Aang's with me. It's the whole reason we came here in the first place, we have to try.
Katara:: Well, I guess if the Earth King knew the truth, things could change.
Toph:: I don't trust the new positive Sokka.  Long Feng brainwashed you, didn't he!
Sokka:: That's probably the Dai Li searching for us. So?
Katara:: Let's fly!
Toph:: Can we please buy a new saddle? Riding bareback is terrifying!
Sokka:: There it is. That whole thing is the palace. The Earth King's chambers should be in the center.
Katara:: We have to be careful. Long Feng's probably warned the King that we're coming.
Sokka:: Why would you assume that? If you ask me, I think we're just gonna sail right in....Ahhh!
Toph:: What was that?!
Sokka:: Surface to air rocks! More incoming! Ahhh!
Katara:: Sorry!
Katara:: Sorry! We just need to get through to see the Earth King.
Sokka:: Seriously, we're actually on your guys' side. Sorry.
Sokka:: In there.
Sokka:: Toph, which way to the Earth King?
Toph:: How should I know? I'm still voting that we leave Ba Sing Se.
Woman in the Palace:: Burglar!
Sokka:: Sorry, wrong door.
Iroh:: You did the right thing, letting the Avatar's bison go free.
Zuko:: I don't feel right.
Iroh:: Zuko!
Sokka:: Now an impressive door. It's gotta go somewhere.
Sokka:: A little warning next time!
Aang:: We need to talk to you!
Long Feng:: They're here to overthrow you.
Sokka:: No, we're on your side. We're here to help.
Katara:: You have to trust us.
Earth King:: You invade my palace, lay waste to all my guards, break down my fancy door, and you expect me to you?
Toph:: He has a good point.
Earth King:: If you're own my side, then drop your weapons and stand down.
Aang:: See, we're friends, your Earthiness.
Long Feng:: Detain the assailants.
Sokka:: But we dropped our weapons. We're your allies.
Long Feng:: Make sure the Avatar and his friends never see daylight again.
Earth King:: The Avatar? the Avatar?
Sokka:: Uh, no, .
Aang:: Over here.
Long Feng:: What does it matter Your Highness? They're enemies of the state.
Earth King:: Perhaps you're right.
Earth King:: Though Bosco seems to like him. I'll hear what he has to say.
Aang:: Well, sir, there is a war going on right now. For the past 100 years, in fact. The Dai  Li's kept it secret from you. It's a conspiracy to control the city, and to control you.
Earth King:: A secret war? That's crazy!
Long Feng:: Completely!
Aang:: Long Feng didn't want us to tell you, so he stole our Sky Bison to blackmail us. And blackmail is the least of his crimes, he brain washed our friend!
Long Feng:: All lies. I've never even a Sky Bison, Your Majesty. Frankly, I thought they were extinct.
Earth King:: Your claim is difficult to believe, even from an Avatar.
Long Feng:: These hooligans are part of an anarchist cell that my agents have been tracking for weeks. If you listen to them, you're playing right into your own destruction.
Earth King:: I have to trust my advisor.
Sokka:: Wait, I can prove he's lying. Long Feng said he's never seen a Sky Bison, ask him to lift his robe.
Long Feng:: What?! I am not disrobing!
Aang:: Right there! Appa bit him.
Sokka:: Never met a Sky Bison , huh?
Long Feng:: That happens to be a large birthmark. Thanks for showing everyone.
Earth King:: Well, I suppose there's no way to prove where those marks came from.
Sokka:: Of course there is!
Earth King:: Yup, that pretty much proves it.
Gang:: Yeah! Woo!
Earth King:: But it doesn't prove this crazy conspiracy theory.
Gang:: Awww.
Earth King:: Though, I suppose this matter is worth looking into.
Gang:: Uh, ok, we'll take it. Yeah.
Iroh:: You're burning up. You have an fever. This will help cool you down.
Zuko:: So thirsty.
Iroh:: Here's some clean water to drink. Stay under the blankets, and sweat this out.
Earth King:: So, this is what a train is like? I didn't realize it would be this... public.
Katara:: So you've never been outside the upper ring before?
Earth King:: I've never been outside of the palace. Now the way to travel. So, may I ask where we're going?
Sokka:: Underneath Lake Laogai, Your Kingliness. To the Dai Li's secret headquarters. You're about to see where all the brainwashing and conspiring took place.
Toph:: It's gone!
Sokka:: Oh, don't tell me.. That's ok, still got my positive attitude.
Katara:: The Dai Li must have known we were coming and destroyed the evidence.
Earth King:: Hmm. That seems awfully convenient.
Sokka:: Hey, if anything, this proves the conspiracy exists even more.
Earth King:: Long Feng was right, this was a waste of time. If you'll excuse me, I'm going back to the palace.
Katara:: The wall! They'll never be able to cover up in time!
Aang:: Oh yeah. If you come with us to the outer wall, we can prove to you that the secret war is real!
Sokka:: If you come with us, this time you can ride on Appa.
Earth King:: Ahhhh!
Toph:: First time flying?
Earth King:: Its both thrilling and terrifying.
Toph:: Yeah, I hate it too.
Earth King:: I have to be honest with you. Part of me really hopes that what you are telling me about this war...isn't true.
Aang:: I wish it wasn't.
Blue Dragon:: It's getting late. Are you planning to retire soon, my Lord?
Zuko:: I'm not tired.
Blue Dragon:: Relax, Fire Lord Zuko. Just let go, give into it. Shut your eyes for awhile.
Red Dragon:: No, Fire Lord Zuko! Do not listen to the Blue Dragon. You should get out of here right now. Go! Before it's too late!
Blue Dragon:: Sleep now, Fire Lord Zuko.
Blue Dragon:: Sleep, just Like MOTHER!!
Ursa:: Zuko, help me!
Aang:: It's still there!
Earth King:: What is that?
Sokka:: It's a drill. A giant drill made by the Fire Nation, to break through your walls.
Earth King:: I can't believe I never knew.
Long Feng:: I can explain this, Your Majesty. This is nothing more than... a construction project.
Katara:: Really Then perhaps you can explain why there's a Fire Nation insignia on your construction project.
Long Feng:: Well, it's imported of course. You know you can't trust domestic machinery. Surely you don't believe these children, instead of your most loyal attendant?!
Earth King:: Dai Li, arrest Long Feng. I want him to stand trial for crimes against the Earth Kingdom.
Long Feng:: You can't arrest me. You all need me more than you know!
Sokka::  Looks like Long Feng is "long gone"! Ha...Oh, yeah, I've been to use that one.
Earth King:: I want to thank you, young heroes for opening my eyes. All this time, what I thought was a great metropolis, was merely a city of fools, and that makes me the king fool. We're at war, with the Nation.
Sokka:: That's why we came to Ba Sing Se, Your Highness. Because we think you can help us end the war.
Aang:: We don't have much time. There's a comet coming this summer. Its energy will give the fire benders unbelievable strength. They'll be unstoppable.
Sokka:: But there is hope. Before the comet comes, we have a window of opportunity. A solar eclipse is coming. The sun will be entirely blocked out by the moon, and the fire benders will be helpless.
Earth King:: What are you suggesting, Sokka?
Sokka:: That's the day we need to invade the Fire Nation. The Day of Black Sun.
Earth King:: I don't know. That would require moving troops out of Ba Sing Se. We'd be completely vulnerable.
Sokka:: You're vulnerable. The Fire Nation won't stop until Ba Sing Se falls. You can either sit back and wait for that to happen, or take the offensive, and give yourself a fighting chance.
Earth King:: Very well. You have my support.
Gang:: Woo! Alright! Good work team!
General How:: Your Majesty. I apologize for the interruption.
Earth King:: This is General How, he's the leader of The Council of Five. My highest- ranking generals.
General How:: We searched Long Feng's office. I think we found something that will interest everybody.
General How:: There are secret files on everyone in Ba Sing Se. Including you kids.
Aang:: Secret files?
Earth King:: Toph Bei Fong.
Katara:: It's a letter from your mom. You mom's here in the city, and she wants to see you.
Toph:: Long Feng intercepted our letters from home? That's just sad.
Earth King:: Aang.
General How:: This scroll was attached to the horn of your bison when the Dai Li captured it.
Aang:: It's from the Eastern Air Temple.
Katara:: Is there a letter for me and Sokka by any chance?
Earth King:: I'm afraid not.
Sokka:: Oh.
General How:: But there an intelligence report that might interest you.
Katara:: A small fleet of water tribe ships...
Sokka:: What? That could be Dad.
Katara:: Protecting the mouth of Chameleon Bay, led by Hakoda. It is Dad!
Iroh:: You should know this is not a natural sickness. But that shouldn't stop you from enjoying tea.
Zuko:: What? What's happening?
Iroh:: You're critical decision, what you did beneath that lake...it was in such conflict with your image of yourself, that you are now at war within your own mind and body.
Zuko:: What's that mean
Iroh:: You're going through a metamorphosis, my nephew. It will not be a pleasant experience, but when you come out of it, you will be the beautiful Prince you were always meant to be.
Aang:: I can't believe it. There's a man living at the Eastern Air Temple. He says he's a Guru.
Sokka:: What's a Guru? Some kind of poisonous blowfish?
Aang:: No, a spiritual expert. He wants to help me take the next step in the Avatar journey. He says he can teach me to control the Avatar State.
Katara:: And I can't believe we know where our Dad is now.
Toph:: I know what you mean. My Mom's in the city, and from her letter it sounds like she finally understands me.
Sokka:: This is all such big news. Where do we even start?
Katara:: I hate to say it, but...we have to split up.
Aang:: Split up? We just found Appa and got the family back together. Now you want us to separate?
Katara:: You have to meet this Guru, Aang. If we're gonna invade the Fire Nation, you need to be ready.
Aang:: Well, if I'm going to the Eastern Air Temple. Appa and I can drop you at Chameleon Bay to see your Dad.
Sokka:: Someone has to stay here with the Earth King and help him plan for the invasion. I guess that's me?
Katara:: No Sokka, I know how badly you want to help Dad. You go to Chameleon Bay, I'll stay here with the king.
Sokka:: You are...the nicest... sister...ever.
Katara:: Easy there, big brother. Though you're right, I am.
Aang:: Katara, I need to tell you something. I've been wanting to say it for a long time.
Katara:: What is it Aang?
Aang:: Katara, I...
Sokka:: Alright! Who's ready to get going on our little men-only man trip
Earth King:: Aang and Sokka, I wish you good journey.  Ba Sing Se owes you its thanks, and we look forward to your return.
Guard:: Your Majesty. There are three female warriors here to see you, they're from the island of Kyoshi.
Sokka:: That's Suki!!
Earth King:: You know these warriors?
Sokka:: Oh yeah. The Kyoshi warriors are a skilled group of fighters, trust worthy too. They're good friends of ours.
Earth King:: Then we shall welcome them as honored guests.
Katara:: Wait, Aang.
Toph:: I'm really gonna miss you guys.
Katara:: Me too.
Aang:: Yeah.
Sokka:: Ahhh! Great! That's enough! Ok, we love each other. Seriously.
Zuko:: Ahhhh!
Aang:: Yeah, girls are waiting for us. Thanks "positive attitude".
Sokka:: Everything's gonna work out perfectly, from now on and forever.
Dai Li Agent:: Dinner. The Council of Five and the military are loyal to the Earth King, but the Dai Li remains loyal to you, Long Feng, sir.
Toph:: Hello? Mom? Anyone home?
Toph:: Hey! Who do you think you're dealing with?!
Xin Fu:: One loud mouth little brat who strayed too far from home.
Earth King:: In our hour of need, it is with the highest honor that I welcome our esteemed allies, the Kyoshi warriors.
Azula:: We are the Earth King's humble servants.
