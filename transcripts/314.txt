Zuko::  No one can make tea like Uncle.  But hopefully I learned a thing or two. Would you like to hear Uncle's favorite tea joke?
Katara:: Sure.
Aang:: I like jokes.
Toph:: Bring it.
Zuko:: Okay.  Well, I can't remember how it starts but the punch line  is, "Leaf me alone, I'm bushed."  Well, it's funnier when Uncle tells it.
Katara:: Right. Maybe that's because he remembers  the whole thing.
Toph:: It's nice to get a chance to relax a little.  It hardly ever happens.
Sokka::  Hey, can I talk to you for a second?
Zuko:: So  what's up?
Sokka::  If someone was captured by the Fire Nation, where would they be taken?
Zuko:: What do you mean? Who was captured?
Sokka:: When the invasion plan failed, some of our troops were taken. I just want to know where  they might be.
Zuko:: I can't tell you.
Sokka:: What? Why not?
Zuko:: Trust me. Knowing would just make you feel worse.
Sokka:: It's my Dad. He was captured too. I need to know what I put him through.
Zuko:: It's not good Sokka.
Sokka:: Please.
Zuko::  My guess is... They were taken to the Boiling Rock.
Sokka::  What's that?
Zuko::  The highest security prison in the Fire Nation.  It's on an island in the middle of a boiling lake.  It's inescapable.
Sokka:: So where is this place?
Zuko:: Why do you need to know? What are you planning?
Sokka:: Nothing. Boy, you're so paranoid.
Zuko::  It's in the middle of a volcano between here and the Fire Nation. You guys actually flew right past it on your way here.
Sokka:: Thanks Zuko.  Just knowing makes me feel better.
Zuko:: Yeah, I'm sure it does.
Zuko:: Not up to anything, huh?
Sokka:: Fine, you caught me. I'm gonna rescue my Dad.  You happy now?
Zuko:: I'm never happy.
Sokka:: Look, I have to do this. The invasion plan was idea. It was decision to stay when things were going wrong.  It's my mistake and it's my job to fix it.  I have to regain my honor. You can't stop me Zuko.
Zuko:: You need to regain your honor? Believe me, I get it. I'm going with you.
Sokka::  No. I have to do this alone.
Zuko:: How are you going to get there? On Appa? Last time I checked,  prisons don't have bison day cares.
Zuko:: We'll take my war balloon.
Toph:: What does it say?
Katara:: Need meat. Gone fishing.  Back in a few days.  Sokka and Zuko. One more thing.  Aang, practice your firebending while I'm gone. Do twenty sets of fire fists and ten hot squats every time you hear a badger frog croak.  Zuko.
Aang:: Nobody else has homework.  One hot squat. Two hot squat. Three hot squat. Four hot...
Sokka::  Pretty clouds.
Zuko::  Yeah, fluffy.
Zuko::  What?
Sokka:: What? Oh, I didn't say anything. You know, a friend of mine actually designed these war balloons.
Zuko:: No kidding.
Sokka:: Yep. A balloon. But for War.
Zuko:: There's one thing my Dad's good at,  it's War.
Sokka::  Yeah, it seems to run in the family.
Zuko:: Hey, hold on. Not everyone in my family is like that.
Sokka:: I know, I know, you've changed.
Zuko:: I meant my Uncle. He was more of a Father  to me. And I really let him down.
Sokka::  I think your Uncle would be proud of you. Leaving your home to come help us, that's hard.
Zuko:: It wasn't that hard.
Sokka::  Really? You didn't leave behind anyone you cared about?
Zuko:: Well I did have a girlfriend. Mai.
Sokka::  That gloomy girl who sighs a lot?
Zuko::  Yeah.  Everyone in the Fire Nation thinks I'm a traitor. I couldn't drag her into it.
Sokka::  My first girlfriend turned into the Moon.
Zuko::  That's rough buddy.
Zuko:: There it is.
Zuko:: There's plenty of steam to keep us covered. As long as we're quiet we should be able to navigate through it without being caught.
Zuko:: We're going down. The balloon's not working anymore!  .
Sokka:: The air outside is just as hot as the air inside so we can't fly.
Zuko:: So what are we supposed to do?
Sokka::  I don't know. Crash landing?
Zuko:: How are we gonna get off the island if the balloon won't work?
Sokka:: We'll figure something out. I suspected it might be a one-way ticket.
Zuko::  You knew this would happen and you wanted to come anyway?
Sokka::  My Dad might be here. I had to come and see.
Zuko:: Uncle always said  I never thought things through, but this, ugh,  this is just crazy.
Sokka::  Hey! I never wanted you to come along in the first place. And for the record,  I always think things through. But my plans haven't exactly worked, so this time I'm playing it by ear. So there.
Zuko:: What are you doing?
Sokka:: It doesn't work anyway.  And we don't want anyone to find it.
Zuko:: I hope you know what you're doing.  There's no turning back now.
Zuko:: I hope these disguises work.
Sokka:: We just need to lay low and find my Dad as soon as possible.
Guard::  Guards! There's a scuffle in the yard, come on.
Chit Sang:: I didn't do anything. I'm going back to my cell.
Bully Guard:: Stop right there Chit Sang.
Sokka::  We can't blow our cover.
Bully Guard:: I've had it with your unruly behavior.
Chit Sang::  What did I do?
Bully Guard::  He wants to know what he did.  Isn't that cute?
Zuko::  Uh, yeah, very cute sir.
Sokka:: Super cute.
Bully Guard:: You didn't bow down when I walked by Chit Sang.
Chit Sang::  What? That's not a prison rule.
Bully Guard::  Do it.
Chit Sang::  Make me.
Bully Guard::  Tsk, tsk. Firebending is prohibited.  You're going in the Cooler.  You! Help me take him in.
Sokka::  Meet back here in an hour.
Bully Guard:: The Warden will deal with you soon.
Bully Guard:: Can you believe this guy?
Sokka::  Prisoners. Am I right?
Bully Guard:: Ugh. Tell me about it.
Male Guard::  Hey new guy. I know it's the rule to have your helmet on at all times but this is the lounge. Relax.
Zuko:: But what if there's an incident? If I'm not prepared someone could strike me on the head.
Female Guard:: Give it a week, he'll loosen up.
Zuko::  Can the new guy ask you veterans a few questions about the prison?
Female Guard::  No, you can't date the female guards.
Male Guard::  Trust me, you don't want to.
Zuko::  No, that's not it. The Boiling Rock, it holds the Fire Nation's most dangerous criminals right? So what about war prisoners?
Sokka:: It sure looks cold in there.
Bully Guard:: That's why we call it .  He won't be firebending in there.  It's the Warden. Look alive.
Warden:: So Chit Sang, I hear you used firebending to try to escape. You should know better.
Chit Sang::  I wasn't trying to escape.
Bully Guard::  He's lying.  I saw him with my own eyes.
Warden:: No one  has ever, ever escaped from here. I'd sooner jump in the boiling lake myself than let that record fall.  Don't forget it. Now  go back to your shivering.
Zuko:: Hey there, fellow guard. How goes it?
Sokka::  Zuko?
Zuko::  Shh. Listen, I asked around the lounge. There are no  Water Tribe prisoners.  I'm afraid your Father's not here.
Sokka::  What? Are you sure? Did you double check?
Zuko::  Yeah, I'm sure.
Sokka::  No.  No!
Zuko:: I'm really sorry Sokka.
Sokka:: So we came all this way for nothing. I failed.  Again.
Zuko:: Err,  what would Uncle say?  Sometimes clouds have two sides, a dark and light. And a silver lining in between. It's like a silver sandwich. So...  when life seems hard...  take a bite out of the silver sandwich.
Sokka:: Maybe we haven't failed after all.
Zuko:: That's the spirit. I can't believe  that worked. I didn't even know what I was saying.
Sokka:: No, what you said made no sense at all. But look,  it's Suki!
Guard:: Prisoners!  Back in your cells!
Suki::  What is it?  Did I do something wrong?
Sokka::  You mean you don't recognize me?
Suki:: You people all look the same to me.
Sokka::  Oh. Then maybe you'll recognize this.
Suki:: Sokka,  it's you.
Sokka::  The other Kyoshi Warriors, are they here?
Suki:: No,  I don't know where they are. They locked me here because I'm the leader.
Sokka:: Well, you  won't be here for long, I'm busting you out.
Suki::  I'm so glad  to see you Sokka. I knew you'd come. .
Female Guard:: 'Scuse me, I need to get into that cell.
Zuko:: No, you can't go in there.  The lights are out... the prisoner  could sneak up on you.
Female Guard:: Step aside, fool.  Hey! Hey! What are you doing?
Female Guard:: Guard,  help!  I think he's an imposter!  Argh! Arrest him!
Female Guard:: Get him off me and arrest him!
Sokka:: You're under arrest!  Don't worry, I'll figure it out.
Warden:: Well, well, well.  I never thought I'd find you in here, .
Zuko::  How did you know who I am?
Warden:: How could I not?  You broke my niece's heart.
Zuko::  You're Mai's uncle?  I never meant to hurt her.
Warden::  Quiet! You're my prisoner now. And you best behave. If these criminals found out who you are, the traitor prince who let his nation down. Why, they'd tear you to shreds.
Zuko:: So what's in it for you? Why don't you just tell my Father and collect the reward.
Warden::  Oh in due time believe me, I intend to collect.
Sokka::  Oh, good. You guys have met.
Suki::  A...actually, we met a long time ago.
Zuko:: We did?
Suki:: Yeah, you kind of burned down my village.
Zuko::  Oh. Sorry about that. Nice to see you again.
Sokka:: So listen, I think I have an escape plan.  I checked out the Coolers again, the whole point of them is to keep firebenders contained, right?
Zuko:: Yeah...
Sokka:: So they're completely insulated and sealed to keep the cold in. Well to keep the cold in it also has to keep the heat out, right?
Suki:: Just get to the point Sokka.
Sokka:: It's a perfect boat  for getting through the boiling water.
Zuko::  The cooler as a boat? Are you sure?
Sokka::  I'm telling you, it'll work.
Sokka::  I walked around the perimeter. There's a blind spot  between two guard towers. It's the perfect launching point. I already tested it out.  We'll roll the cooler into the water and just float with the current.  It'll take us straight across. As long as we don't make a sound,  no one will notice. And bing, bang, boom we're home free.
Suki:: But how are you going to get the cooler out?
Chit Sang::  Yeah,  how are you going to get the cooler out?
Sokka::  What?  We didn't. We... We didn't say that.
Zuko:: Yeah, you heard wrong.
Chit Sang:: I heard you hatching an escape plan and I want in.
Zuko:: There's nothing to get in on.
Sokka:: Yeah, the only thing we're hatching is... an egg?
Chit Sang:: Ok, well, I come with you or the Warden  hears about this too.
Suki::  I guess we have no choice.
Sokka:: Okay, you're in. Now, first we need someone  to unbolt the Cooler.  From the inside.
Chit Sang::  Oh, I can get you inside.
Chit Sang:: Ugh. Hey, what are you, stupid  Watch where you're going!
Zuko:: Hey, you watch who you're shoving.
Chit Sang:: I think you mean I'm shoving.
Sokka::  I need backup over here.
Guard:: No firebending.  Into the cooler.
Sokka:: I can take you back to your cell if you've learned your lesson.
Zuko::  Yes, I have. Completely.
Sokka::  I got Suki and Chit Sang out of their cells a few minutes ago. They'll be waiting for us at the shore.
Zuko:: Someone's coming.
Male Guard::  Yeah, new arrivals coming in at dawn.
Female Guard:: Anybody interesting?
Male Guard::  Nah, just the usual. Some robbers,  couple of traitors, some war prisoners.  Though I did hear there might be a pirate.
Female Guard:: No foolin'.
Zuko::  War prisoners. It could be your Father.
Sokka:: I know.
Zuko:: Well, what should  we do? Are we going ahead with the plan or are we waiting another night?
Sokka::  I don't know.  Is it right for me to risk Suki's freedom? All of our freedom on the slim chance that my dad is gonna show up?
Zuko:: It's your call Sokka.
Chit Sang:: Took you guys long enough. This here's  my girl and my best buddy. They're coming too.
Sokka::  Fine, everybody in the cooler. Let's go.
Zuko::  Are you sure you want to go?  You're the one who said you wanted to redeem yourself. Redeem your honor. Rescuing your Dad is your chance.
Suki::  Your Dad?
Sokka::  If I had just cut my losses at the invasion, maybe we wouldn't be in this mess. Maybe sometimes it's just better to call it quits before you fail.
Zuko::  No, it's not. Look Sokka, you're going to fail a lot before things work out.
Sokka::  That's supposed to make me feel better?
Zuko:: Even though you'll probably fail over and over and over again.
Sokka:: Seriously, not helping.
Zuko::  You have to every time. You can't quit because you're afraid you might fail.
Chit Sang::  Hey,  if you two are done cuddling, can we get a move on?
Sokka:: No, I'm staying.  You guys go.  You've been here long enough.
Suki::  I'm not leaving without you, Sokka.
Zuko::  I'm staying too.
Chit Sang:: Not me, I'm out. Let's roll baby.
Sokka::  We gave up our only chance of escaping.  I hope we haven't just made a huge mistake.
Chit Sang:: Argh, this current is so slow.  I can use this to paddle.
Warden::  Guards! Secure the perimeter  and lock down the prisoners. Now!
Sokka:: The plan failed! They're caught.
Warden:: Get the fugitives and throw them in the Cooler!
Guard::  Uh, they are in the cooler sir.
Warden::  One that's bolted down and not floating in the water! This is a lockdown!  We have new prisoners arriving! Everything must be completely secure!
Sokka:: The gondola's moving.
Sokka:: This is it.
Sokka:: If my Dad's not there, we risked everything for nothing.
Suki:: We had to.
Sokka::  Come on, come on.
Zuko::  Is that him?
Sokka::  My Dad doesn't have a nose ring.
Sokka::  Where is he?
Sokka::  That's it? That can't be it.
Suki:: I'm sorry Sokka.
Sokka:: Oh no.
Guard::  Hey you,  get off  the gondola.
Sokka:: Dad.
