Aang:: Aren't airbender stories the best?
Katara:: Was it realistic? Was that how it was back then?
Aang:: I laugh at gravity all the time. Haha! Gravity.
Storyteller:: Jingle, jingle!
Sokka:: Sorry!
Storyteller:: Aww. Cheapskates!
Aang:: Hey thanks for the story!
Storyteller:: Aw, much obliged little bat thing!
Storyteller:: What are you prattling about child? Great grand-pappy saw the air walkers last week!
Great Grand-Pappy:: Heya!
Aang:: Hey, we're almost at the Northern Air Temple! This is where they had the championships for sky bison polo.
Sokka:: I'm saying you're an optimist. Same thing basically.
Aang:: Hey guys, look at this!
Katara:: Huh! They really are airbenders!
Sokka:: We better find some solid ground before it finds us!
Audience Member:: Go Teo! Show that bald kid how it's done!
Teo:: Hey there! You're pretty good.
Aang:: Yeh, I know. But I can do more than fancy gliding!
Teo:: Wow! I don't think I can do that! But here's a good one...
Teo:: What do you think?
Teo:: Hey! You're a REAL airbender! You must be the Avatar! That's amazing! I, I, I've heard stories about you.
Sokka:: Wow! This glider chair is incredible!
Teo:: If you think this is good, wait until you see the other stuff my Dad designed.  is seen in a recessed portico in the wall, but it too seems dirty and befouled as does the rest of the room. Shafts of sunlight do filter in, but the steam and dust make it look shadowy.)
Aang:: This place is unbelievable.
Teo:: Yeh, it's great isn't it?
Aang:: No, just unbelievable.
Katara:: Aang used to come here a long time ago. I think he's a little shocked it's so... different.
Sokka:: So better!
Katara:: I'm sure some parts of the temple are still the same.
Aang:: It's nice to see even one part of the temple that isn't ruined.
Voice:: Look out!
The Mechanist:: What the doodle! Don't you know enough to stay away from construction sites? We have to make room for the bathhouse!
Aang:: This is a sacred temple! You can't treat it this way. I've seen it when the monks were here. I know what it's supposed to be like.
The Mechanist:: The monks? But you're 12!
Teo:: Dad, he's the Avatar. He used to come here a hundred years ago.
Aang:: Our gliders.
The Mechanist:: Yes, little light flying machines. They gave me an idea. Build a new life for my son, in the air! Then everyone would be on equal ground, so to speak! We're just in the process of improving upon what's already here and after all, isn't that what nature does?
Aang:: Nature knows where to stop.
The Mechanist:: Come the pulley system must be oiled before dark.
The Mechanist:: The candle will tell us. Watch.
Sokka:: You put spark powder in the candle!
The Mechanist:: Four flashes, so it's exactly four hours past midday, or, as I call it, four o'candle!
The Mechanist:: If you like that, wait till you see my finger safe knife sharpener!  Only took me three tries to get it right!
The Mechanist:: Follow me!
Teo:: Hey Aang, I want to show you something.
Aang:: I just can't get over it. There's not a single thing that's the same.
Katara:: You're right. They're kind of keepers of the temples origins.
Katara:: Hey! It's just like the one in the other Air Temple.
Teo:: Only an airbender can open it â€“ so inside it's completely untouched, just the way the monks left it. I've always wondered what it was like in there.
Katara:: Aang?
Teo:: I completely understand. I just wanted you to know it was here.
Aang:: Thanks.
Sokka:: These lanterns are terrible! I can't see.
Sokka:: Why would you want to use fireflies for light?
The Mechanist:: Hey! Close that up! They'll get loose. Fireflies are a non-flammable light source.
The Mechanist:: Cover your nose and hold your breath.
Sokka:: Okay, so you brought me all the way down here to see an empty room.
The Mechanist:: Wrong.
The Mechanist:: It's filled to the brim with natural gas. Came across it my first time here. Unfortunately, I was carrying a torch at the time. Nearly blew myself and the whole place even more sky high.  Thought my eyebrows would never grow back! Anyway, there's a vital problem that needs solving. From time to time we have gas leaks and they're nearly impossible to find.
The Mechanist:: Yes, until I figure out how to locate something I can't see, hear, smell or touch.
Teo:: What?
Aang:: That's the something you're talking about.
Teo:: Yeh, I suppose it is.
Teo:: Are you ready?
Katara:: No!
Katara:: I can't believe I'm flying!
Aang:: Just make sure to keep your mouth closed so you don't swallow a bug!
Katara:: Teo was right about the air! All I had to do was trust it. Let it carry me.
Aang:: Even though Teo's not an airbender, he really does have the spirit of one.
Aang:: I've been thinking. If you wanna see what's in that room, I'd be happy to open the door for you.
Teo:: Great!
The Mechanist:: I said don't touch anything!  Oh, don't worry, that experiments old and that egg was just part of last week's lunch.
The Mechanist:: Quick! Find that egg!
Teo:: I can't believe I'm finally going to see what's inside.
Sokka:: How could something that's so small you can't even see it make such a big stink!
Sokka:: Yeh!
Sokka:: If we put a whole mess of rotten eggs in the cellar where the gas seeps up...
The Mechanist:: The gas will mix with the smell of rotten eggs...
Sokka:: Then, if there's a leak...
The Mechanist:: You smell rotten eggs! Then you just follow your nose to the place where the smell is coming from...
Sokka:: And plug up the hole where the gas is escaping!
Both:: You're a genius!
Aang:: This is a nightmare.
Teo:: Explain all this! Now!
The Mechanist:: It was about a year after we moved here. Fire Nation soldiers found our settlement. You were too young to remember this tale. They were going to destroy everything, burn it to the ground. I pleaded with them, I begged them to spare us. They asked what I had to offer. I offered... my services. You must understand, I did this for you!
Aang:: When are they coming?
The Mechanist:: Soon.  Very soon.
Aang:: You can't give them more weapons.
The Mechanist:: If I don't give them what they want they will destroy this place.
Teo:: How can I be proud of you when your inventions are being used for murder?
The Mechanist:: I need some time to think.  You need to leave! Go!
Teo:: We're not leaving!
Emissary:: You know better than to keep me waiting.  Give me what you owe us so I can be on my way.  Well?  Is there a problem?
Aang:: The deal's off!
Emissary:: The Avatar!
The Mechanist:: Aang, don't get involved!
Sokka:: This is bad! Very bad!
Katara:: Aang, what are we gonna do? How can we possibly keep them all away?
Aang:: I'll tell ya how.  We have something they don't.  Air power! We control the sky. That' something the Fire Nation can't do. We can win!
The Mechanist:: This boy's a genius!
Sokka:: Thank you. You're a genius!
The Mechanist:: Thank you!
Sokka:: See, the problem with the old war balloon was you could get it airborne, but once you did, it just kept going.  You could put a hole in the top, but then all the hot air would escape. So the question became, how do you keep a lid on hot air?
Sokka:: A lid is actually the answer. If you control the hot air, you control the war balloon.
Katara:: Hmm. That's actually pretty smart.
Sokka:: Okay, we've got four kinds of bombs. Smoke, slime, fire and...
The Mechanist:: ...stink. Never underestimate the power of stink!
Little Girl:: They're coming!
Teo:: Are we ready?
Katara:: Yes, but where's Sokka with the war balloon?
Officer:: Take them out of the sky, now!
Aang:: We've got'em on the run! We need more slime!  with blasts of air, but their central cabins of the tanks just flip over and they begin advancing again. The shoot more fire blasts at Aang, who avoids them. Cut to Katara on Appa flying next to Teo, all surveying the battlefield.)
Katara:: Those things are unstoppable!
Teo:: I think I know how they work. I remember my Dad tinkering with the counterbalancing system. Something to do with water. Works great, huh?
Katara:: Water? Can you get me close to one?
Teo:: No problem!
Teo:: We're out of bombs!
Katara:: Come on, Sokka, where's that war balloon?
Sokka:: Hey, why aren't they shooting at us?
The Mechanist:: Bomb away!
Sokka:: Oh no! That was the last one!
The Mechanist:: Wait a second,  you smell that?
Sokka:: Rotten eggs!
Sokka:: There! That's where the gas is escaping!
The Mechanist:: What are you doing!? That's our fuel source!
Sokka:: It's the only bomb we've got!
Aang:: Look! They're retreating!
All:: Yeh!!!
Sokka:: We're going down!
Katara:: No! Sokka! Hold on!
Sokka:: Get ready!
Aang:: You know what? I'm really glad you guys all live here now. It's like the hermit crab , maybe you weren't born here, but you found this empty shell and made it your home. And now you protect each other.
Teo:: That means a lot coming from you.
Sokka:: Aang, you were right about air power.  As long as we've got the skies we'll have the Fire Nation on the run!
Commander:: This defeat is the gateway to many victories.
